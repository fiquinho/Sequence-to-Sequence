Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Joey.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Can we go now?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
So did you
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Why?
Never
How many people were in your old school?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You wanna go out with him?
That's what I just said
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
She kissed me.
Away.
Forget it.
Nope - just came by to chat
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
That's never been proven
You didn't
William - he asked me to meet him here.

Why 're you doing this?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
You know what they say
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
You decided.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Dr. Ruth?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
Excellency, you are right.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
The Judgment is ours!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Yes... I remember...
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Not bad.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Why?
... and also to bring medicine.
That's what it says.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
New worlds create new people.
That she was impregnable.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We don't need to know.
We can't be.
You think I don't know that?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Where are we going?
I was all of these.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No.  No way.
But it's...
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I'm glad I met you.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
What was that, Korfin?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
No, what is it?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
You got any better ideas?
Something back home?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where is escort service?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Surprise!  Surprise!
As a plumber?!
I want to hear everything he said.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
How did you start the fire this time?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Not good.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I guess it isn't.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Yes.
Roger.
What is it, Hal?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Fine.
Are you quite sure?
Fortunately, they did.
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Thank you.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Shit.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Luther's on the move...
Partnership?
Yeah?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I still don't think it's loaded.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
How would you know?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
This ain't a credit business.
At your service.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
You noticed...
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
What kind of mission?
Of course.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Perfect.
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
I don't think this is a good time...
He's on vacation.
I thought you were divorced.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
Uh...
OK, you can turn around!
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
...The rain falls...
I love you...
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Actually only one cell survived..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's our deal coming along?
Why the gun?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
You don't understand...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Hmm.
I want to watch you work.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Look, I don't know what this...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
I know what you did.
Who is this.
Fuck you!
Who is Machine?
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
How much did he pay you?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Never mind how I found you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Yeah... guess so.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Interesting theory.
Snuff films.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Okay.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
Will you let me look?
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
None too discreet, is he?
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Who?
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Don't worry, honey
Huh?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Had kind of a long night.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Krueger is reality.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
I want to talk about the baby.
All of us.  Right?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
So they caught up with you, too?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
The sound again?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
After torpedo room:  Report!
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Minus three.
Come where?
Who?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
No.
Chub says you're fired.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
That was me.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Really.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What blood?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
It's fun.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No what?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Fine.
You mean Twombley?
Like hell.
So?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Yeah, lots.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Oh, Wade.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Can't it wait, then?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
She's coming.
Wade?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
This doesn't make sense.
Yes, Mr. President.
Ga get it.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Nine.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Scared. We're scared.
I know he left you behind.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Did we tape the Duke game?
That's my job.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
What's the story?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Dunn.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Ted, please be careful.
I mean until we start to burn up.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Yes, sir.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Negative.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Yes.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
I can't tell.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I love you.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Would you go up, please?
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Why'd I do what?
Back off, George.
Your mother mates out of season.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
You are married?
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Thank you.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Only holds five.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
She's right.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Do it!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Stand back.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Why not?
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Extremely clever.
What?
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Yes!
Why not?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Yes!
No!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What?
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Behold!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Yes, Sire.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Well. There it is.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Yes.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene.
Are you sure it's an opera?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, we can.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Herr Sommer.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
How much?
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
Are you ill?
Of course.
Sing it back.
With the tenors.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
You go fast!
Exactly.
But, Your Majesty -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Leave me alone.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Then you must know this.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Yes?
Yes, in the third act.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Ah.
What? Who the devil are you?
Well, promise then.
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Thank you.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor?
What did he say?
Warn him?
And what else?
What shall we do?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Twenty-eight.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
A werewolf?
Charming.
I was awake and he was in my room.
I should be committed.
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Oh, come on, tell us.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
I really don't know.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
You ask them.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Pecos Bill.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Come on, where?
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
Plan?
Thanks a lot.
Life mocks me even in death.
David!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Jack, are you really dead?
He's on the telephone.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Then you have some hot tea?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
You here again? What do you want?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
About twenty-four thousand.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
What is?
Well, what?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
My apartment.
Good for you. Come on.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Much better this morning, thank you.
Thank you!
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Happy now?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Now don't you worry about it.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I can't tell you.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Is it safe?
All right.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Was it twelve o'clock?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Never a good thing.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Leave me alone, Bob.
I ain't done --
Swear.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Sorry.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Sure, cousin.
What will be?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
It's a secret.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
You can shut up now.
What do you think?
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Got any ideas, little brother?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
I'll explain on the way.
Damn.
I figured.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
By burning down their homes?
And it is my pleasure to be here.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Oh, that's the best part.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So you can't tell me anything?
In English, Pinkerton.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pick me up?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Maybe.
Yes?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Evelyn?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's good-looking.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
See you then.
When?
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Paul Owen.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
So was I.
Actually, yes.
Oh.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
'Gonna wait outside.
...But?
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What're you -- what?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
You can't just walk in, either.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
No.
I don't think he knows how.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
What?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Skywire.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
...Worse?
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
What're we looking for?
I'm calling Gary.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You know my name.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Show me.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
You'll come up with something.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
You're not listening.
Where is he?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Good luck, Austin.
Be careful.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Groovy!
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Why not? It's a question.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Here, use mine.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Of course, luv.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Who?
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Indeed.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Likewise.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Hey, wait a minute--
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Great.
You didn't...
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
No need. I'll call again.
... death ...
Hope...
Eh? In here!
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Rules are made to be broken.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
June, July ... August?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
You mean my other self ...
Very good, Steed ...
Any ideas?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Orders.
Have a look at this.
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
I see.
I shall need a small plane.
How did you guess?
Insane ... ?
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
You are, and it's behind you.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm going now, Cole.
It looks awful.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
What's the matter?
C'mere.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
A real turd.
Any time, Al.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Screw that.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I want women.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
I just want to be alone.
You can tell a man by his friends.
It's all right...  So have I.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
I'm not really hungry.
Got me.
Very.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
No.  I need a drink.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Just come down, John. Just --
It's comin' along... want a beer?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- Never mind.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Roll the hose.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
You're selling dad's boat?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Homey.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Leave Stephen out of this --
You're right.
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
-- Another backdraft.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Well, let's have a look.
He's out.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Me?
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
All right, cop. I want my money.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Give me some?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
You might be right.
Meaning?
No offense.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
It's been a long time.
Pleased to meet you.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Do you know how you will use him?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
You getting cold feet?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Break a leg.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
What you did is dead wrong.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
You tellin' the truth.
The one with da big...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Aw, c'mon.
Good morning.
That is none of your business.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Have you had one?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Then you must get it.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
What is to be done?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Is he all right, papa?
I beg your pardon?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
What do we do?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Okay.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Do what?
He's telling the truth up to a point...
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Then who did?
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Who killed Pike?
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
What are you talking about?
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Got it.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
They got their stories straight.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
For what?
Isn't this how your story goes?
No death certificates. No crime.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
I don't think I want to hear this --
No one else heard it?
Fifty minutes.
What.
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Then it's unofficial.
Sir, yes, sir!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
No one's ever left.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I see. I thank you for your time.
Go.
No, I understand.
Please?
I never knew.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
I'm not scared.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
Okay.
Oh, so you know.
Dad?
Son?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Go out with me.
I wasn't expecting you.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
But it's not true.
Of course.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
That's okay?
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Yes.
Ch...
You can see why it's sensitive?
He says he feels safe here.
What?
I...
Tell me what he said.
No. It's not that.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes I know.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Have you got your passport?
You don't want to talk about it.
I don't hate you.
And? What are you saying?
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
No.
Are you scared?
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
Okay. Thank you.
Maybe you will find out.
Just wanted to see.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Now wait...
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Stop what?
Yeah.
Better'n me?
Let go...
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Wait. He left.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I ain't in a hurry.
I guess you have.
Looks like you know a song.
Maybe I won't.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Like I told you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Ain't gonna be moved?
One thing at a time, Laz.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Rae don't do this now...
Yeah, I know.
Got in a little accident.
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Let go...
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
The Wolf?
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
What'd she say?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
A snitch?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
A resort city, Beppu.
So I bring some cheese?
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Luck.
Why's that?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I don't think so.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
I'm taking you back.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
He was my partner.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
You trust me?
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
And what can he do for you?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Like what?
Of course not.
His company made us.
Industrial refuse.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Yeah.  I got it.
You start.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
The umbrella.
Vodka!
Sorry, don't have the time.
No thanks.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
No.  I got a problem.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
Why not?
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What difference will it make?
What?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
What's up?
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Your mom was a dancer?
Sure.
How do you do?
Yes, ma'am.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I just had a mental picture of...
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
It was amazing.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Okay.
Name it.
A wife?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Everybody's divorced.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
What?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
I promise.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Like one of Mom's?
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
That's what everybody believes?
Sorry, that's the largest city.
I don't think so.
What?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Goodbye.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
How do you do, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Yes.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Good god.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
The locks?
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Some time.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Well, that's blunt!
Always good advice.
To bed?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
Give it back to him.
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Um...uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yes sir. I sure am.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
I'll go then.
See my breasts? See?
Yes.
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
Yes.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
On a ride.
What kinda beer do you like?
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Yeah. okay.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I'll get a coat for her.
Hey Jeff.
Good deal Dad.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Okay.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Stop it Mike.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
I can't find the second one, sir.
What are you saying?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Shut it. It's Ma.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
A-fuckin'-men!
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
You killed my... my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
What about one guy with two guns?
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Shit! Shit!
Who were the victims?
We promise.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
This is some crazy shit, man!
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Nothing. Go ahead.
Dignan! Stop!
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Yes, they are.
You were spoiled rotten.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
True.
They don't?
Bob?
Right here.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
We said 48 hours.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
He seems pretty good.
Yeah. As a girl.
You're all clear.
Nobody move!
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Come on, Kumar.
I'm not kidding.
What do you mean?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Scale the --
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Take a deep breath.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Yeah. He said that.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
I didn't do anything.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
Where were you?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
I don't know about that.
No.
So who's going to know?
Let's cut the bullshit.
It's true, Dignan.
Good question.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
I told you they were there.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
I'm going back.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Yes, I do.
Run. Run. Let's go.
Do you have your own cell?
Can't get it. It won't... 
You got that?
Got a little lucky.
Never heard of it.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Okay.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
Look at me.
Because you're afraid!
I don't know who that is.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
What if it's not who you think it is?
You do?
I want to hear it from you.
Bourne?
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
So he fooled you.
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Peace?!
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
You win.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Did it work?
I... accept your proposal!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
No, protecting her.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
I know, but...
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
...yes.
Me neither.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
No.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, Monsieur.
You want my advice?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Yes, Monsieur.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Good day.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Oh, darling!
Has it got a wow finish?
Richard, I had to see you.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I don't understand. What about you?
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
Of course, I'll be careful.
How do you do?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Are you quite finished with us?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Manages what?
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
-- Thanks. I will.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Is everything ready?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Will I see you tonight?
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Survive today, that's the point.
No.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
I've got lots of time.
Let's take a look.
Not if you work for FedEx.
I can't take him to work.
Yes there is.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Sure.
What's going on down there?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
I braided them.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
To life.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Better than I can!
I know.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Daddy, *please*...
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
What do you want me to *do*?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
He's leaving...
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Is that soon?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
What about the trees?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Where'd she get you?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Yes, for both.
It looks like scurvy.
It's my turn!
I'm happy I amuse you.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Right.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
That's it.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
This has to happen fast.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
And these cops? What do they get?
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
It's not true.
She walked.
Guess so.
So we go to the bar.
Come on...
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Calls?
That's it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
I can't do that.
I think two million.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
We're not cops.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh-huh.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
What do we need another Shill for?
What?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
And we got rid of the red head.
With identification.
You going to have the time?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What?
So what do you want?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
No. Thanks.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
I won't be that long.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
I've got something to tell you.
Fine.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
I hate public transport.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
What for?
Do you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Some other time.
What the fuck are you talking about?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Give me 365.
Wipe your hands.
How?
Yes.
The key!
Oh, God...
I read the same here.
Energy shielding positive function.
And I saw that I was alone.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Naah. All stable.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Guess you're right.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
How I make my living, what's your point?
Guess again.
How come I never hearda you before?
You mean until you showed up?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Could you give us a moment.
You're roommates?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
A grand.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
No...
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Something.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You did go through my stuff.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Somebody's got to.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Open it.
Look, thank you for this but--
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You did.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
You know what I'm saying.
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
And she bought that?
Right, the big one-oh.
But I'll take a rain check...
You left out condescending.
A toy?
And why should she?
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
I want you on call here.
He's sick.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Gin.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Weird...
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Go ahead, Jam.
What?!
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No...
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah.
Good morning...
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
How much longer is this gonna last?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
My mom is gone.
Why? Is this about the book?
Who's Frank?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Grandma Death.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Frank.
I asked you about school.
Yes.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Regret.
I think now that he might...
Frank is going to kill.
Guess who wrote it?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
He was a year ahead of us?
Yep.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
She's right over there.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
Yah?
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
We was robbed.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
All right, let's go.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
I will if you shut your piehole.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
"My dear"...
"My"...
His Excellency's car!
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Yankee Poodle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
You told it to me.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
It must be done right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Once more! 
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
I still like UPSTART the best.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Oh, would you...?
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, these things take time.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
I want him back!
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Please do.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
What a mess.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Romance!
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Want to come out?
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
My... name is...
John Merrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Your mother?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Oh no, I couldn't.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Well...
WELCOME?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
You're as bad as my father.
Not quite...
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
You're just saying that.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Yes... oh, yes...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
What a stupid idea.
Why?
Well... no...
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
Well, you ARE!
Make your mind up.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
You'll be sucked down too!
But...
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go...
Well, where is he then?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Get away, Snorri.
You could charge him what you like.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
That's right.
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
I hate you! I hate you!
You liar!
Me too.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
In the room?
In the world.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Okay, I guess.
Why?
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Really? Because --
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I don't really know how --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Yes?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
It's okay.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Um --
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
No.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
This is our first "date" date.
And I didn't have an argument.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think, before.
When?
Joel, come here. Please.
Make love?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
And what are you like? A wino?
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
It's not somebody else.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
'Night.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
Listen, it's not erasing.
I swear.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
What do you want, Stan?
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Just wanted to let you know.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
That's your problem.
I don't.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
About...
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
So now you're bummin' around?
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Justin?
I'll get him.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
Hurry.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Nothing. It's nothing.
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
How do you know all this?
I'm going in.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
The Core...!
Watch me.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
Starck...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time to fart.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
No. It was someone else.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
No. I'll be right back.
He served on the Goliath.
They're explosive charges.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Yes.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Five times.
I had it at four.
He's made a few changes.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
So are you!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
You've been working out.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
They're not costumes.
But all these people...
Now.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
We need to get past them.
That's what we're here to find out.
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
It's the first door on your left.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Manager!!
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
See you later.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Well...
Come on...
Let's continue.
We've got to get an abortion?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Totally.
I like sex.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
I paid for it and everything.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He's not coming.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Where do you feel like going?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
What about those other guys you live with?
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
I've heard that, too.
Not at all.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Sure.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Not for me.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Naw!
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
Lacerda?
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Are you ready?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
Us?
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
This is a fucking nightmare.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
No! I swear I'm not!
I fear nothing.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
Nah, I got the gun.
With what just happened upstairs --
Gonna stay for a couple?
Anyone.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Easy.
What's it for?
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Who's with me?
Anybody else?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Okay then.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
What?
Good.
Nothing.
Seven.
Duh hickey.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Wait God-dammit!
Let's lock off this room.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Excuse me, sir?
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
He knows, Frances.
GET OUT!
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
...Yes.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
See you next weekend?
Occupation?
Are you really serious? About acting?
...Not if I can help it.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Oh no...
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Frances...
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I took the early rounds.
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I'm not sure.
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Fine!
I live here.
What?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Yes, Mama.
No!
But what -- 
Oh bullshit.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Oh for Christ's...
No!
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Yes. Very close
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I give you my soul...
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Somebody has to!
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
A... week?
Thank you, Henry.
I have no knowledge of that.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
The strain was evident.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
I finished the boats.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
I can't, Barry...
Where'd you get that stuff?
Thanks.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Good call.
I love you.
Ned!
Mmmmmmmph.
Rocky Road.
Those things can be nasty.
One night on the town.
Another coincidence.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
The truth hurts.
I have no idea.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Real McCoy.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
To yours.
In the Winnebago.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yes.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
-- you got your shower --
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
You callin' him a liar?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Keep your voice down.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
They broke when you fell.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
Where are you?
Yeah.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
I'm not sure what --
Sir?  What did he say?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
No, ma'am.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Which is guy-speak for...
How hard they making it on you?
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Whose orders were those?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Just askin'
Mighta been civilian.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
We know, Audrey.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Only one way to find out.
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
What?
Sure. I'd like that.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Speak of the devil.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
Really? A girlfriend then?
Well, I think you're cute.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
That's right.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Where are you?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Right... Sorry, sir.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
"The show must go on."
Leadership....
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Could they be the miners?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
It's okay. Listen-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
There is no weather in space.
I never get tired of that joke.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
... What does that mean?
OK!
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
We're doing episode 31?
Not a clue. You?
I don't think that's a cloud...
Turn on the translation circuit.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Sure, no problem.
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
We pretend...
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Okay, let's go.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
A lot of years have gone by.
No.  I guess.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
To hell with Arnold...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
I'm not sure.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
Makes you gag.
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
The British army, sir!
What's the difference?
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
The man is a traitor!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
You must be very rich.
Get these men back in line!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Yessir!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Africa, of course.
I think America suits you.
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Come here, Farrah...
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Harry, let me answer that.
She's... young.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Let's see how we get along.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
Compass.
Who told you that?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
...That's what we finally decided.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
"Cotton".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
What do you think?
I want to know.
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Sixty pounds.
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Oh yeah.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
What about running number two by itself?
She take a radio?
How about you Epps?
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
Murphy.
What is it?
What the fuck -- ?
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Don't fall asleep.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
Because of the gold.
She was sailing up north, right?
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Same. Any luck?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
Collision? With what?
I don't know, are we?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
So you killed them?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Looks like it's adrift.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Give up?
Maxine.
God, how horrifying.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
But I can't --
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Oh my God, that's HIM!
You need counseling.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Good.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
You loser!
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
It's always closed...
"Hassle"?
Should we leave a note?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Where did you get that?
Anthony's II!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
So should I come over?
Great...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
How much is this?
Seymour does.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
It's kind of falling apart.
Fine, and how are you?
Hey, where are you going?
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Wow!
Really? Can I see it?
Oh, right...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh yeah?
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well when can we do something?
And you like them?
...What do you mean?
What's up?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, well I like you too...
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
I have no idea - I just want to...
That slut!
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Yes?
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
-careful, Abdullah-
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
What?
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Somehow I guessed. 
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
Don't they have to be?...
Why?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Not even close.  What happened?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Oh no.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Okay, that's no problem.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
His name is Oscar.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
I'm not even good for me.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Hi, Egon.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're right.  We should stay.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
I command you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
And we're the ...
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
I'm Peter --
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I'm ready.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Well, thanks a lot.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Like a used car salesman.
What?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Out!
Don't scream.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Take me now.
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Print is dead.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
In the physical sense.
That's so romantic.
What calls?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I'm not at liberty to say.
And may I see this storage facility?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
A square?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Oh, shit!
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
That's what you told me two days ago!
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
I don't know...
But have never been?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
You're hearing about somebody else.
That's what worries me...
Yours will do!
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Well, we can try...
Well, they die for it!
Athenians...
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You teach them!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Chain him.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
But could you try?
No.
Yes.
And it's all over now.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
No.
Here? In Berkeley?
-- really incredible --
What?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
If you want.
Don't you have it on?
I don't know.
I might.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Why do you have to see him?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes I am.
Plastics.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
No, sir.
What?
Ahh -- thank you.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
What?
Please.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
I don't know.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Pardon?
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Then why do you keep running away?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
What?
I want to say something first.
Oh my God.
Of course.
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't you get it.
That's fine.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Benjamin.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
A hanger.
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You're not interested in art?
No.
I don't remember.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
What?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Really. I want to know.
Then let's hear them.
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Now don't start this.
I don't believe you.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
About what?
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Oh no.
What?
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
You miss the point.
HUH?
It's Benjamin.
They are?  Come on.
I don't believe it.
Yes, sir.
I could take care of her.
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
That.
Free --
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
All right. We'll dance.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
For tonight. 
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
And then --?
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
What is the matter?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
No?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Nobody, Doctor.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
You're trembling.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
With the same friend?
You're a little too fast.
...weight into the balance...
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Well -- you want me?
A thousand marks -- 
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
What?
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
We did not approach you.
What a session this has been.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Such nonsense.
Please.
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You're discharged.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
I know -- I know.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Well -- gentlemen.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
You know who I work for.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
Roy Dillon.
No?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Why?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
This way's perfect.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Uh-huh.
Never.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
This time...
You're too young. You should be in school.
I am in school.
Let's find out.
Mm?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I'm a salesman.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Sure.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
I went out to Delmar.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
That's what I say.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
I like a woman who takes control.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
No shit?!
No shit.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
No.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
John...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
It's always John.
Doesn't make it bad advice.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Where's Shane?
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Then they can watch.
Promise?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
You stay away from him!
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
But surely Rogers isn't --
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
Or what's left of him.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Jamie's baby ...
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
You know what gets me?
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Let's talk about it some other time.
The educational process.
You know me, boy.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
What's this?
Maybe it's time you got out.
You.
I know you think that.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
No.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Tell me that.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Sir?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Penelope!
Penelope!
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Situation.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
Ram it up your ass!
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
No you're not!
A dozen?
Almost a Christmas scene.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Where's the bullet?
Load it for her.
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Good night.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
You were wrong, you quack!
Yes.
You haven't heard me yet.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
And terror, if you don't mind.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
What happened?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Don't worry about it.
What's this?
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
It's beautiful.
I don't get it.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I see.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
How nice.
You were wonderful.
We made the date three months ago.
What kind of a life is that?
Meaning?
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
Not true.
Phooey.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
No.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
No, I don't.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Just one.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
If you say so.
You making a feature?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
She's dead.
Say what?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Shit.
You really believe all that?
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
Where does he live.
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
And better?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Who made it?
I don't know.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Just leave me alone.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
Okay.
But I...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Was he with a girl?
No.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Hello.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Oh, at the dentist's?
My door is always open.
She seemed yare to me.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
What?
What is that he's working on?
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Maude, do you pray?
With Life.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
A sunflower?
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Can't complain.
A rough estimate.
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
What else do you like?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Your studies?
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
You think so, sir?
Another man's life in your sights.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
Harold!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
But wait...
Time to play.
Kyle, you don't have...
I've got to finish it.
And what about you?
Who?
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Didn't even buy me a drink.
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Who wards off demons.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Don't move. We --
My arm is fine. Where are you??
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Red, I --
Doesn't sounds like him.
He's just pushy.
Strong.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Yes, I --
My fucking hand!
Lucky man.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
I don't want to see the dress.
Oh my God.
Frank.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't.
Just to your left.
Where's Daddy?
I saw everything.
I cut myself.
Let me see.
So damn stupid.
No you won't.
Come with me then.
I wonder, maybe...
No personal details?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Wait a moment --
I said: I found a room.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
You will keep in touch.
Kitchen's through on your left.
What?
I'm afraid it's true.
I have to get out.
Just upstairs.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
It's not what I heard.
What did I say?
Really.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Ehh.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
How do you know about that?
What the fuck is that?
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
None.  Christ!
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No way.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed...
You can be and are wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Oh, hi.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
My house?
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
And do you like it that way?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
It's me.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I'm a good person.
Those aren't mine.
Well, think about it.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
C'mon.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Hi.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
To make you feel better.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
No use.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you persuadable?
Well, you've asked.
Well she --
It's a crematorium.
Enough of what?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Yup.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
Well call her mother.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Why?
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Have you gone to the police?
You want me to front for you.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Yes.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
No!
What do you want from me?
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Stop!
How can you know this?
You know me home.  Me name.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You are the same?
I don't understand.
We are immortal.
You will live.  Survive.
Aye.
But we cannot be killed.
I am not ready for this.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Far away.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
You're wrong.
Romirez is dust.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
Mulet.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
We have no understanding.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Thanks.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
What are you doing here?
You're insane.
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Get up.
Did you know the victim?
What are you getting at?
He's mistaken.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Hello, Bensinger.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Thanks a lot.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Your luck's not with you now!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Done what?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I'm not working for any other paper!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
Thanks.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
What tricks would I pull?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Never mind that. What's the story?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I know, but --
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
In a way.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Walter, you can't do that!
I'm busy, Duffy.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Beats king up.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
So long, Hildy.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I did.  Hold the wire.
I won't.
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Here!
That's good.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
What are your beliefs, Earl?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
The City Sealer's office!
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Come on, fellas.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Very well, Grandpa.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Do you know any swear words?
Could.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Except the servicemen.
Jam.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
The ideas you get in your head.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Father, that's enough now
And now we're glad you did.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
Baby! Stop!
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I don't drive cross country.
She's pretty cute.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
There's a dog in the road.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Is that all... think real hard.
How's about you give me those same directions.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh.
So what?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Shhhhhh.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Sleeping.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
That's the understatement of the year.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
You said it, not me.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Where we headed?
Call Wydell.
Right.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
I always favored the Hulk.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Like father, like son.
Oui. Perfect!
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
When you were a little French girl?
Yes. Happy happy.
No.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Be still my crotch.
You've got to respect that.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
What's the larger experiment?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Do you?
Yes.
Flares?
That's very funny.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Your entire body?
You are an animal.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Ooka.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Lila?
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Yep.
You want a chaser?
It's open...  What'll you have?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Sit down.
Deal.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Thanks for the drink.
To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
I been thinking.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
Where?
You hustlin' me?
How're the hands?
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
Tell her what?
Half.
Well, here it's half.
I'm a businessman, kid.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
I feel tight -- but good.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Eddie...
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
What time?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Okay?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
What?
Fine, thanks.
Eight o'clock.
Thanks. I will.
Fair.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
You don't look like a college girl.
So why go to college?
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, it's not bad.
Give it back to me.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Well, what else does?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Just for luck.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
What about... now?
My wife.
Yes.
What's inside?
Yes.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I surrender --
That's fine.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
Sure ... fine.
Good night.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
I'd believe him.
Why?
No.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
Why, yes.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
Cool.
You have to leave the White House.
A toast to the end of the world.
You bet it did.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What happened?
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
I don't hear no fat lady.
ETA with target; four minutes.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
It had been deemed classified.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
You know me...
Sorry for what?
Yeah, but what an entrance!
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I'm a dancer.
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
Peace? No peace.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Lower me down.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
I'll never forgive myself --
He was actually there? You saw him?
I came here to save you.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Dad!
Oh.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
And do I detect a rebuke?
You call this archaeology?
Penitent. Penitent...
Junior?! Dad...
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
Where's my father?
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
Miss Scott panicked?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Lao She.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Step on it, Short Round!
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Just try and control yourself.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Willie!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
So now they believe me.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Me.
Yes?
Your name is Al...
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
I just went there for a job.
Why he's argumentative?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Go out, take your first left.
What does it say.
Take a left and your next right.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Don't know.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What about it?
Follow it.
Which language?
What?
It worked.
Rene...
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
Run, stupid!
That's not funny.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Drink lots of water.
No. You can't trust her.
Probably.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
I don't know.
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
It's all we've got.
Oh, I can't.
Then how did you know?
They took the tapes.
Surveilliance on them all.
He work for us?
What about it?
Thanks.
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Who?
I don't know Who.
You...him...UST.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
The poet...something he said...
Where?
...right here too.
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
You're doing...Okay.
Why'd you run off?
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
No.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Hiroshima.
Ryuji and Gruner.
He plays it all the time.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
What'd...you forget?
What did you tell them?
Why?
For you.
Now what?
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Thanks.
Just one. The back up.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
I heard them.
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
Monday.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
Thomas Sandefur...
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Use the bathroom.
I have to take a shower.
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I'm with Don on this.
Oh, please, Mike...
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
How have you liked your stay?
If you want to do it.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
You okay?
Good.  You have kids?
...okay.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Jeff...
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
I can't say that!
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
What do you mean there is no family?
A delivery device for nicotine.
Poor communication skills.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Seven...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Well, I wouldn't say --
Here. Got pictures.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Triple!
Grounds?
Mr. Massey?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
Is she Asian?
What?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
He's passionate.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Oh. And that is -- mom?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I know.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
What do you want?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
I thought so.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Jesus.
He was right, wasn't he?
I wish I had your discipline.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
I guess.
Ha Ha.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Thank you.
I don't know. I can assume...
I'm not sure.
Video.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Three is not Farrow.
Yes, sir?
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
That's an evasion.
I might.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
No.
Oh, no—no.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad—
Are you going to see him?
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
No.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
You win!
Are you talking to me?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Outside!
Like this. I have no robe.
Must be the Spring.
Thanks, professor.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
It takes money to buy food.
Yeah.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
know—but—
A black eye. 
You bet I did.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Eight o'clock.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Don't accept any more.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Don't "Joe" me.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Who's she gonna marry?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
I ain't got a hat.
A trumpet?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
I don't trust him.
Yeah.
What's the idea?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
No.
Not one word.  That's an order.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Keep saying what?
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Yeah.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Dave?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
There were admirals.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Take a look across the street.
What are you driving at, boss?
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
Allen Dulles?
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
And what would I have to do?
Do you walk home?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I know. That's why I went.
I understand.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she willing to give us?
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
I'm not saying another word.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Can I see your I.D.?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
The Delfonics.
What?... What'd you do?
You're not old. You look great.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
What'd ya see?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
I go back to work tomorrow.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
I called you last night.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Why?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
It's not that simple.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What's he doing?
Spain.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Are you scared of me?
What the fuck is that shit?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
No.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
Uh-uh.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
Dreaming.
Thanks.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I'll give ya ten.
I can do that.
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
What does she think she's gettin?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
Did you ever go I one?
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Uh-huh?
You sure?
Are you serious?
That's good money.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
You couldn't just hit her?
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You have it with you?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Yes.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
I know where it is.
I know where to turn.
You sure?
'Ola!
Where do you want to go?
Then what are you doing here?
What isn't happening?
Well, how do I look?
I could have told you that.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Well, try, huh.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
It's cold.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
He told me he was going to Hell.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
What can I tell you?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Likewise.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
I don't want to know.
Don't ask.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
I must have been out of my head.
Why you left.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
I enjoy crushing into you.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Hey, I'm here.
It's gone to the top.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Are we in Brooklyn?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
He did? When?
I want to know. You tell me!
Me neither.
It's so hard to believe.
I promise.
Jake, what is it?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Where are they?
Shows how much you knew.
Who then?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Please come quietly.
Where am I?
Of course it is. What else could it be?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Nope.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
He doesn't like it.
Pause play.
I don't know. Nothing.
Rizzo did.
He....He...
Cool.
They're back here.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Hey, easy now.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Hey!!
Were you close to your father?
Okay, good tip.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Obviously so.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
That's right, now if you could...
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Three...two...one...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Sure, Dad.
What?
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Michael! Come inside!
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
Our friend, the shark.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What do we do?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
That means closing the beaches.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
What else could've done that?
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
What do you see?
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Charisma?
Is that normal?
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Why?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Yup.
What a trip, man.
What are you talking about?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
You don't have to do that.
Why? What the big deal?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Go learn something.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Really? Fingernails?
Sure.
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Wow! It's magical.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
Is this Juno?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
There are ads? For parents?
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Or stage parents!
You sound shocked or something.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
What are you referring to?
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele for god sake please lis...
You can?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Vernon, Florida.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Why?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
No, never. Excuse me.
Shut your mouth.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Who are you?
You're clean.
Let me smell it again.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Yeah.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
That.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah. Do it again.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Tonight?
Yeah.
Because, you know why. You know.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
No.
I tested positive?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
You're OK?
Yeah?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
You still mad at him?
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Whah?
Yeah.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
No.
But then I won't need your money.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yes.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
No.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Maybe you should.
No it wasn't.
No, I need the original note.
You think he's dirty?
You alright?
Did anyone stand out?
You're not going to tell me that.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
Then call them!
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What makes you think I was there?
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Why did he what?
Come here.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Thanks, David.
But you promised.
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
And this Jeremy--
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
What does that mean?
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Ten days ago.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
I went out.
I want to be the best I can.
I can check and call you back.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Do you always open quickly?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
I don't think I could.
You mean like in the steam room?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm not playing a game now.
No.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
I'm sure you are.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
The new Queen lives.
You have rope?
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
You have not slept in two days.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
The Beast will kill her.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I can. Because I choose it.
What business?
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Hand over your dinner.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Hush!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
She bore you many children?
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Why do you want to know?
...Office 2702.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
I never rent my gear.
When I say I love you.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Nothing, for the moment.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Messina.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
...Yeah.
Then...
Where?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I've seen it before.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
I don't follow.
Yes.
Don't be so sure.
Good.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Nine.
Pulitzer, here I come.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Don't do this.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Oh, that's not mine.
Forty-seven years.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
No.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Yeah... I'd like that.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Where have you been staying?
With an old friend.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yuri... are you...
That's right.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Are we done for today?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Just the love in my heart.
What?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
No!
I'm her sister.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Really?
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
No way --
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
What do you think?
What, like on va-kay?
What?
I got bangs!
Really --
Where's Warner?
I don't know --
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
And I fully support that.
No.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Yes.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Why do you say that?
Pull up next to him!
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Purely a precaution...
Not from me, surely...
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Do it now!
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Might we watch, too?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Cathay?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Will you lead me to her?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Jack, don't!
Ogg's footprints!
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Sapphire!
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
They'll do nicely.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Shhh!
My father and the Baron.
My own father...
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
What?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
No!
Only that?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
Up ahead!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
Why?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
He jumped into the ocean.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
No thanks.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
He's not the type to worry.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
A sink?
If that's what it takes.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
No I'm not!
You don't have a choice.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Why?
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
Hey...hey!
I might have a solution.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The gloves on the table are for you.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know.  Why?
What would you like to be?
Getting high, I guess.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I would have killed him.
That's so weird...
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She's a little sad, is all.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
Where have you been for a week?!
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
I can't leave the house?
Do you remember?
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
This was my very first slow dance.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
If I weren't married?
What?
Don't even...I'm there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
You can't go because of Sam?
Take it off.
You got a dog?
Why?
I didn't go in your room.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Nagger?
That's my girl.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
But you can't.
Sharp.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
But I'm having a good time...
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I know it begins with a "C"...
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Nothing.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Claude.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
What'd you say?
You drew this?!
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
The hell you talking about? What train?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
So?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
You killed Santa Claus?
Made just for you, Cookie.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Movin' it out, boss.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
1932? That's like, that's like...
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Jenny?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Show him Central Park.
Try an angel.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
You're already there...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Coulda been much worse.
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she, do you mean he?
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
See ya, fellas.
All right...
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Andrew.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
You have a dog? What kind?
Good. I was concerned.
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
What?
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
From? From? From?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Did you?
I'm fine...  See you...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Here.
When do you go up?
I changed my mind.
K.
And then you killed him, right?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
We'll convince them.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
And yours.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Don't ever let go.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
And Sanctuary?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
What people?
Hello.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't think so.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
His or ours?
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
What's he do?
Pornos.
In pornos?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Yeah. Call him.
Yes.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Yeah.
Do ya good.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Pete, what happened to you?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Wake me up when you get home.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
You're my man, Pete.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't know.
Yeah.
Come on.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Go home, Sheila.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Okay, brother.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Yes!
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Come on, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
It's unbelievable.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Leaving?
When are you going to start?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
How do you do?
Thank you.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
So there are others?
Who, for instance?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
—buy and sell?
108 and still active?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The only one.
Shall we have another?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Yes.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Did I say "if"?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I don't need any proof.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Maria?
You're wrong, George.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
What if he refuses?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
Where are we going? Huh?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
A man whose life was empty!
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Perhaps.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Cowan--
It's not even a fucking door.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
It'll make sense later?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
I taught kindergarten.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
What?
The radio show?
You think that's what's-happening?
Get back in the car!
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Actually, you may have.
They respond to fear, right?
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
You're not taking me in!
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
This guy.  Where was he?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
What is it?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Who wanted her little girl back?
Somewhere.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
We know each other?
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Yes, sir.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I show a cop on horseback.
Everybody runs.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
But you call this room the "temple".
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
I need help with her.
Oh, Sean --
I forgive you...
No.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Do you?  Really?
I thought you were retiring?
Sean --
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
I'll be right there.
Wait, just a second...
I don't understand --
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
How?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Two?
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
How many?
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
You mean after he lost your son.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
You're Bobby, right?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
As far as...?
See you later.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Holy shit.
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Uncle Bobby?
Mommy's not home?
What time is it there?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
I feel weird asking him.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
How could you let her see this?
5-5-1.
Get away from her.
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
He must have that shit troughed.
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
They were out of line --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Yeah. Sorry.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Yeah.
What drill?
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What about it?
What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
I'll page you with the number.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
You sure?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Nothing else.
So they said more than the address.
Don't even start.
About what?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
You fucking nuts?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
I'm your soldier.
Did you hear what he just said?
You're out of money?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
What about it?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
S'up.
A little.
Stop.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Watch it...
Come, now. You just got here.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Thanks.
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Who's up for a night on the town.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Yes, sir.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
The bitch was there.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
What do you do with your time?
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I love you.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do you want me to do?
Dear heart, where are you?
That's enough, Brother Earl.
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
Just what is your question?
Then we don't know that God was white.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Say what you're saying.
If she got eyes, she do.
Now you come back.
Your control over your children, therefore --
And don't come back.
You better believe it.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Eat lead, coppers.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Who's he?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[I want you.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Who's Emilio?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
That's right.
I'm not crying.
Yes.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Are you afraid of me?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Is that good or bad?]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
So am I.
Two tourists who never went home.
That's what friends do.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
I'll call her up.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Where?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I feel fine.
Who?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I'm thirty-four.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Please...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
How do you do?
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm just here with another girl.
I never thoughta that.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Sure.
She didn't look Italian to me.
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
Well...
That's all right, that's all right...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Call Dago Red.
What do you think, Trapper?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You betcher ass, General.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
I think we could still have a chance.
How did you get called that?
You're an attractive man.
Something else we have in common.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Oh, get out of here!
They can't do that to me!
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Are you all right?
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Against anything. Just protest.
Yes!
John Doe. The one in there. 
No.
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Yes, sir.
Oh.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Awwwww!
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Shut up!
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Four bits.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
No, I didn't write it, but—
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
No shit! He's good!
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
That's right.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Yep.
For now that's all.
I've rarely shot anyone.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Is there something wrong with that?
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
I'm not good at lying.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
You're a compulsive gambler?
Yeah, first and second.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
We won.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Which apartment?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Greg.
Maybe you should be.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
It's very nice.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Who's running it?
What do you need?
I need to take back what's mine.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Go!
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
What?
That's right.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Insurance?
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
It was a test.
I know.
But you were with me.
Sorry?!
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Resurrection.
Describe program function.
Checking connection.
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
There should be a way to open it.
... Let's take a look over there.
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
We could smell it's breath.
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
GO POWER RANGERS!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Poor, yeah.
Not another word.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Who hired the bastard?
Long as Charlie says.
You got something to hide?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
I'll do fine.
Come off it, Bugs.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Never threaten me, Boss.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
They're friends of our enemy.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
You get fifteen percent.
Masseria's been after me too.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Hell. It's been four days!
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
What?
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Uhh - martini?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Sad commentary, huh?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Why?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
You're acting kind of...odd.
Ohhh, nothing.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
My <u>tail</u> itches.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Aaron?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
I'd love to.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
What happened?
... Manly?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
You've never *seen* this contract.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Drunks are funny--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
What?
What?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
That infernal phone!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Why, of course.
I beg your pardon?
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Will he yield for a question?
No, Jeff--please--!
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
How's Amos, Ma?
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Office of--Senator Smith?
No!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
A *day*!
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Calendar?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
Have I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Not another bill?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
I know that.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
Yes--
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
It's crucifying him--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
Oh yes, pixilated.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
Oh, I don't mind.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if—
What did they say?
Yes.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
That depends on what they see.
What's that?
Really?
Sure!
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
It had better be good.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
No. It's nothing.
Yeah, then what?
With pay!
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
With pay!  She is out the door.
Last night he proposed to me.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Boy, was he burning.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
He's not home, I tell you!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
All set.
You're going to New York with us.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
That's funny. Why is that?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
I'm Chairman.
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Huh?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
I don't know.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota north.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I did what!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Hmm?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Why's that?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
How do you mean?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Mr. Follett.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
She seems very unhappy.
I do.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
Who was that?
It was Henry Follett.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mumford... like the town?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
Why don't you tell me?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Is that like a party trick?
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Will you think about it?
What is your name?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Was it something that happened at school?
What'd he say?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Good-looking woman.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
It matters to me.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Well, okay then.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
In the desert? What for?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Perhaps.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
What did you do to him!?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Proceed!
I would never!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Twenty.
Broad?!
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Trust me.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
Preparation for what?
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Not unless you call me Rick.
No, we are not.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Awfully.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
What --?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
What did he mean?
I dunno.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Really?
Just a waitress.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Who?
Yeah.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
We had an off night, that's all.
With what?
Who's chicken? 
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Or both.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Are you sure he's still alive?
Right.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Proceed.
I'm glad you like it.
What do you mean?
No, thank you.
You could have them here by daybreak.
You realize what is at stake?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I don't know, sire.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Bertrand, sire.
Oh, shit, that's not right.
Ah-hh, no.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Does your mother know you have come?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Lisette.
And you, Junot?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Of course.
Yes.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Why not?
What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I'm his cousin.
Black magic.
Fuck, what's his name?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
Sorry about today, man.
Me too.
No, man, just wait.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Yeah, pops!
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Sorry, dude.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I don't know.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Call me.
I got fired too.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know the number.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I can't feel my legs no more.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Nothing.  What you want?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
My security people are right next door.
For not believing you.
What about the gun?
How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.
I kill her - and you kill me.
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right. Kisses to you.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
Everybody does?
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You're a big girl, huh?
It doesn't look like it.
Right there.
You, Preacher?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Dad, you're bleeding...
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
She went.
She went.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
So you ain't with the State no more?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
All to pieces!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
Get along with you.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
It'll spoil our supper.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
He ain't my Dad.
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Huh?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
What's taking you so long about it?
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell.
What?
Mm-hm.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have this?
Ahh!
How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
What happens if they don't do that?
Great.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Just want to talk to him a second.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Jungle man fix Jane.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
You should be more careful, Anna.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
What do you wear in the morning?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Or we can't go back to Russia!
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
No, no.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
The Duchess...
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Yes, General Savitzky?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Comrade Kopalski...
Right away... instantly!
We did it with the best intentions...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Au revoir.
Business.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
You believe in our cause?
I must get into that country of yours!
Me?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Then do it through my lawyer!
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
This is a place for workmen.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
What?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
No speech?
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Much happier.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Please.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
You can't imagine.
No... please...
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
She's gone, Leon.
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
What?
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Madame, if you...
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You leave me no choice.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
How do you do, my friend.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
You think this is just about politics?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
That's what they're doing.
For what?!
Cox!  Fire him.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
"Security" is not strong enough.
"National Priority."
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
I won't tell him if you won't.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
There's no other choice.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
That has the added virtue of being true.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
Ernie Davis.
Oh yeah, he's good.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
No, sir ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Are you serious?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
How you been, Ellis?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
You don't know what he thinks.
Most don't.
No ID in her room?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Nothin'?
Some pretty bad people.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Llewelyn!
What? Quit hollerin'.
Just keep it up.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I can hear it in your voice.
And where is that.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Where does he work?
You expect him?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Sixty-nine cent.
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
What time do you close?
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
You've lived here all your life?
Sir?
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
What room?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
Yessir. I understand that.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Sugar?
Yes.
So was I.
I don't know. American citizens.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Oww! My arm, careful!
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
No, Elden, I need to...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...to see you.
Umm, I don't think that...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Yes, ma'am.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
What happened when you were twelve?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
How many men have I talked to?
Who?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
You should have a little faith in people.
Where are you going?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Really. And where was that, old man?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
IT SURE IS!!
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
I wanted to make a statement.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
...who doesn't?
Can I have an evil twin?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Yeah? The sport utility?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Sure.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
David Ravell.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
Her show?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Fire! I hate fire!
Four hundred, Delmar.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Okay, Everett.
He was never turned into a frog!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Okay, Pappy.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, we need that ring.
It was in his bureau.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
But... but...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
It was a powerful air.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Why?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Yes, sir!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Great.
No. I never feel like that.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Me, too.
He didn't give you much choice.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
It sure was.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
That's brilliant.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Sure.
Yeah.
A little.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
I can't.
I know.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Shut up.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
And we're never getting in.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Huh?
No ball, kid.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
Nobody leaves.
478-0150.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Fuck.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I saw something, I saw...
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What's up?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Man, fuck you!!!
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
You got it. Berkeley?
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Yes sir, I did.
We're like policing the police.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
And who is we?
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
No.
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Pride will do.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
My pleasure, sir.
Very well, proceed, sir.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Flanking riders?
No...
Granted.  Where are you going?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Where?
No, I don't.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's right.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
Yes.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
But what about Thomas?
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Put them away.
Bite?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
I will. Come and kiss me.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Yes.
I hate that smell.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Do you believe that?
I'm sure you're not.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Yes, but--
We're still not where we're going.
You're telling me.
I guess so...but...
Because it's right.
What?
Well...a touch of the flu...
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Shit! Look at this mess!
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You don't understand--
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
And Church will be fine.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Yes, I guess I do.
You're doing fine.
That so?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Did you, now?
Would that I could.
I can't breathe.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Commodore, please!
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
That he is.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
You would do that?
Pirate.
No.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
I'd die for her.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
'Bootstrap?'
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Not that.
That might work.
The trunk.
Yeah, I do!
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Okay.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Yeah, we'll see.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
Mouse?  What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
We don't?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
What waste?
That was 'simple'?
The waste.
No, why?
Blame the victim.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
What did you want my hair for?
Something else I want to try.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Yes.
I have to!
We lost him.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No? Why not?
No - give you another guess.
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
How-di-do.
Of course I am Stewart.
Now let's get this settled—
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Good morning. What does this mean?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
You're acting like a child.
Mother!
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
With me you can always do business.
Why not?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Sure.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
It's the smoke.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Must be my wife.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
To Old Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
What did he want?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Good.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
Well, at best you might deny it.
Surely, come right in.
You don't.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
I won't.
I love you too.
No, no ... Come on in.
She's crying.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
What are you doing?
"Changes."
No. Of course not.
What do you mean!?
What is it?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Get lost!
I'm not sure.
To who?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
They're happy like this.
Nothing.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Wow.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
I'm not sure.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
McIntire's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
What the hell's going on!
My name's David.
Where are you going ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Oh.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Just listen to me ...
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Aren't you a little early?
Open it.
Just a little--You know.
What's the rush?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Hey.
Cool.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
No, no, no.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
What's the listing?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
I know.
Yeah I can't.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Nothing.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Where is she?
You sound very cute, very nice.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Georgia.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
-- you said you did.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I saw a picture of you.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
Did you pick it up from the street?
This is Lena.
Really?
Yeah.
Have a good trip.
yeah.
It's so nice.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
I thought that you were anyway.
You can't do that.
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
What do you mean?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Mhm.
Can you hang on a second?
Why you wearin' a suit?
No thanks.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Where you goin?
Ok.
I need to talk to you for a second.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
You have another house somewhere or something?
What is this, man?
Well....what do you want, then?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
You can't be late.
Ok.
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
That's it.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
Once or twice.
At your service, Count.
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
There I was taxed; it's true.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Valcour. His chair.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
Coulmier, you animal!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
Yes?
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Quite.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it awfully violent?
What's that then?
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Oh, but I am!
And I in yours.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
You've come to lecture me?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Very much.
Houdini mice.
And he did.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
The actor
Yeah
Yeah
This picture--
I will not have this in my home.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Not for me.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Oh Christ...
We're doing Hearst.
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I'll hire you  -- right now-
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Why her?
The title?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You're lying to me.
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
It was a -joke, George
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
Happy birthday.
Yeah.
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
What?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
You want the title shot?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I did keep an eye...
So what?
Whadda ya mean?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
I just wanted to say hello.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Who asked you?
I was just...
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
What?
Positive.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
OK. Talk.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Sure, what else is new?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
He should.
No, you're his wife.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
His wife took a trip.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Ever get an answer?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Did you get my note?
I don't know what you mean.
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Stella!
She's only perfect.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
Would four of them -- ?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Not a word.
Only because it's expected of her.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What about it?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
Staying the night here, uninvited.
The same.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What?
Yeah!
Yes.
What would you do, Dad?
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I was talking to Jim.
Yes, sir.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Hi there.
What?
What?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
You sure?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
Come on!
Goodbye, dear.
Why should you be the only one.
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Grandma?
Wash up and go home.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I felt like it.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
He hates me.
That one?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
A man of some travels.
Don't hurt him...
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Radio said negative five.
Radio said.
No, no --
Saw me --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
I love you!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
I love you, Nick...
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
What are you talking about?
I never told you my name.
Put him in the truck.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Why not.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No, Gabriel... no...
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Show's over.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Haven't thought about it.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Ash... Ashley...
...for Christmas...
Do what?
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Elois?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Sure.
Take a seat.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
No, they're not.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I do.  How do I look?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Fuck all that.
Dead.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
What?
Well, he knows a little about me.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
If we don't, he'll die.
That fuckin did it!
There's a slight difference.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Where do you keep the can opener?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Hold on.
You're not going out to look for them?
All right -- it's said!
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
How'd you happen to miss?
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
There's only two of them now.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You better start.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
I don't care what she asked you.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
I just wondered. Let's go.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
Three men on matched roans?
I can't take her with me.
What's there to be fair about?
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Well, say it.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
What's the use.
Everybody knows --
What for?
Maybe I could start you out.
Good night, Steve.
No.
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright!
Let's get outta here.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
I think so.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child, you're alive!
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Would you please focus?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Just a little experiment.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Just a little Rogaine.
Thanks, handyman.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
What she said about your mother?
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Why?
Looks good, Mom!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
That's nice.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
FUCK YOU! 
Are those pussy-willows?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
It's sugarless.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Which room is it?
Yes.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Yes.
Goodnight, Mary.
But you do believe me?
What things? Why?
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
That you love Mary.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
They may have been friends of hers.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
Cloven hoof?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Unless what?
I'm very, very serious.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Why?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
But she was here?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Yes?
Why
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
It won't hurt.
Oh.
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
You mean like "time flies"?
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
How do you mean?
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
Agreed.
Ann. Hello.
I can see that. What are they?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Not really.
No.
About sex?
What about sex?
Like what?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
This is just... so...
I know.
Yes.
What difference does it make why I do it?
Sometimes. Afterward.
About who?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Can't or won't?
What was the problem?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Subtlety?
But if you were?
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Why not?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Not very often.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
No, I haven't.
No, he left last week.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Yes.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Do you have to say that?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Cynthia!
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I don't want to discuss it.
It's a sun dress.
I just want to know why you're here.
Yes.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
He doesn't have to tell me.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Right.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Graham.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
It'll just be me.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Shut up!!!
Yeah.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Was he nice to you?
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Yes.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
I don't get it.
Time to check with Flavors.
I got it!  I got it!!!
I got it!  I got it!!!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
...closed?
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Fast!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Good. That's good.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
Gary.
Nice.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
And get your bone smooched.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
When do we get to drink it?
Just a minute!
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Perfect.
How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
What?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Okay! Fuck!
I will.  See ya!
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
You're an asshole.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
What's happening?
Huh.
It's private.
Let's leave it alone.
Are they too sporty?
Thanks.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hold on.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
The Windmill.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I'm sure he believed every word.
Oh, Maya. No.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Ken.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Exactement!
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
A hair.
Dad!
Clear for what?
You want him coming in the house next time?
How can you say that?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
I'm looking!
I'm close.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
What about them?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
No.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Don't worry.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
It was my fault.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
You'll never make it.
McKendrick's men got him.
Right.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
It's one thing to know it...
My name is Emmett.
You got no idea what they were after?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
They got a saloon there?
He is that.
I've got a job.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Never will again.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
We'd rather stay.
I don't have any family any more.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
I've given that up.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
Well, thanks, but forget it.
So we understand each other?
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
The picture's dead.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
I'll walk you out.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's true.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
No.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
You?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
How much wine have you had?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
You're with me to be close to her?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
There's... a wall between you --
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Don't be.  It was worth it.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
This week anyhow.
I know plenty of boys.
Really?  Too bad.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
The background is.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Taller?  What?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
You could play the lead.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
... digitized.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
You use needles?
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
Dr. Crowe.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
They don't know they're dead?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Maybe.
And you know what else?
Standing next to my window.
Meaning?
Superstition.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Not according to these.
I happen to be a professional.
...Hi.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
I didn't do anything --
No shit.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
I don't think so.
Not while you're driving.
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
Don't look.
Never.
Like your guitar break.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Whatcha' doin'?
And this is mine.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby --
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no!
When one sees you they all see you.
Gold--digger, huh?
Margaret.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
How much style?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
You just passed your nemesis.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
I'm begging.
I'll do it.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Or in the slammer.
Not for long, you ain't.
What's your twenty?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm here.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- so you shut them off?
Is your security team armed?
And a very bad gamble.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah.
And threw us into the lake.
Two of 'em?
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Yeah, why.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
-- will be handled back in --
I wouldn't go that far.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Shoot.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
How are we on time...?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Why did you agree to come here?
He's dead.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Oh, that's a relief.
How long can you go without sleep?
That depends.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Dead?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
To calm your anxiety.
You talk like an actor.
Then it's God, right?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I did too.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Sartorius.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I'm disgusting.
Neither did I.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
It's an experiment.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Yeah.
He said he'd kill me.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
No kidding.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I'll miss you, Mike...
I don't know.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Let's do it.
Yeah.  It's all over.
You don't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Claire...
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What?
I can still use a gun.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What about Tommy?
No.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
What about when she identifies him?!
I heard.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Take care, pal.
Let me see.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Hm.  What a lump.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
What's this? A cockaroach?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
It's too early to be clever.
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I think I'd like that.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Waldos.
Peter-- my condolences.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Let's talk in the hall.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
In this barracks?
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
We're looking at it.
Which one of you is what?
You are talking crazy!
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
What do they always say?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Yes, sir.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Borscht?
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Russian women prisoners?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
A chicken?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Thanks for pointing that out.
When is it expected back?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
And destroy every planet in the system.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
I hope so, sir.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
You're in the Nexus.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Can I?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Please, I insist.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
I always do.
What do you want?
No.
No, I didn't know that.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
There are no other ships in the system.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
It's a little early to celebrate.
... Or <u>who</u>.
David --
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
I'll go...
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
. He will remain always as he is.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Yours...?!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Who is this?! How dare you --
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They know we would die first.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Sir, may I --
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Say thank you.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Our first order of business is survival.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
I can hardly see --
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You can't!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Visual --
Rake her.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Aye, sir.
A few shots, sir.
Try the emergency channels...
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Or the one.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Engine room! What's happening?!
Trying, sir!
Battle stations.
I'll try, Captain.
I exaggerated.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
A moment alone, please.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
That is what I said, Doctor.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
We are launching everything we have.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
You've already been that. C'mon.
... You're very perceptive.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
... Who are you?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Permission granted.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
I cannot tell a lie.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
I will, Admiral.
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Picture, Uhura!
On screen!
On speakers.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Will it?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There are caves in those mountains.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
I aspire to be more than I am.
Sometimes I do.
No, I mean...
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
It is not over.
It is over.
What kind of concerns?
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
The Ba'ku.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Do you know how they were damaged?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
On screen.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Was I doing something to your neck?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
Not yet.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Something wrong with that?
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Wil... Data was down there.
Riker here.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
You may need assistance, doctor...
We've been set up all along.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
I checked the data banks, yes.
Spoken by you?
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
I know what you mean...
Shields up, Captain --?
Now we go to Starfleet?
Onscreen.
Aye, sir.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Right -
Sir?
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
They're dying.
I am uncertain.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Confirmed, Captain!
Nevertheless.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Soon then.  I’ll save the last dance for you.
To happy endings.
On my way.
How can you be sure?
No, I do not mind.
Emergency force fields are holding.

And I you.
I know how he thinks.
Counselor?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Do you have life support?
What do we know about the population?
We’ve got him!
Ready, sir!
Aye, sir.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Not with the Romulans.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Captain!
Aye, sir.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
No race should be a slave to another.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
I see more than what you are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Let's go.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
No -- this is wasting time.
I have a purpose.
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
No.
Thank you.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
About five miles back.
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
When can we expect containment?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
What.
Gear shift.
Police...
Flashlight.
Pancakes.
Money.
Shit?
You want to try it?
Music.
Yes.
No.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Why?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Goodbye.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Yes. Sing some more.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I will go. But not you.
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
Nothing.
You don't forget anything, do you?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
I will wave to you.
I must go.
No.
Goodbye.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Very beautiful country up here...
It could have been anything.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
You saw that?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
No problem.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Make me forget it, baby.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Why me?
W'sup, Max?
So lay it off to somebody else.
I already got everything I need from you.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
No.  It didn't.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
You really want that on your head?
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Yeah.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
What?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
You're a... you're sick.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Who?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I don't believe this.
"Was?"
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Five months. I love it.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
And one other thing.
He thinks he looks young.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
I know.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Yeah, of course.
No weapon.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Yes.
How's the arm?
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
You have to put things in perspective.
You're right. I know.
Shuddup.
What do you drive?
What's that like?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
It does.
Anything.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
No.
...Four days..?
I'm a "Dorothy".
...And she's with someone else.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Sorry?
Why not?
What do you do, Trent?
Yeah. And an actor.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Goodbye. I lov... 
Right... or more likely the opposite.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Why?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Classy.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
Ah, there's the rub...
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Well, that's dumb.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
...He's derivative...
Rejected?
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
What Vegas?
You're crazy.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas.
Did she, or did she not smile?
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
What an asshole.
I don't know...
...gotta...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Sorry about interrupting...
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
How?
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...a day...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
This version doesn't have fighting?
A day.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
...Is he brown?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're money...
Sue!
...Definitely...
Be smart about it.
Good.  He never doubted you.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
And this?
For killing a man.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
You want him to stay in this country.
Where are you going?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Okay.  One minute.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Right.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Michael...
Goodbye.
Let HER ask.
Don't ask me.
You just stand here one minute...
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
Probably a year...
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
Yes, I promise.
I do wish to be baptized.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
He talked to you?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Shut up!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Say again?
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
You're breaking my ribs!
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Is Freddie here?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
That's good.
I've got plans!
What?
How?
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What are you doing?
Dickie?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
I think it might hurt her to know.
I just don't believe that!
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Frances?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
What?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Marge!
Tom.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Excuse me?
Hello.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Emily.  Just kidding.
How did you know that?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
That's good, isn't it?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Peter, I... I...
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Is there a firing range around?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I can believe that.
Really?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
What?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
I'm leaving.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
But... Betsy...
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Oh, Tom, please.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This is gotta be a game, right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
You sure he's not Italian?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Just follow me.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
The kind with a brush.
No.
Could you see anything?
And what happened?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
You carry a piece? You need one?
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Do they drug you?
Pittsburgh.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
What should I do? Call the cops?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
I know. I tried that.
Military record?
No, I want long shifts.
Why?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Well yes I suppose ...
Wait.  Where're you going?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Hi.
I am, too.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Damn...
Delly?  In here.
Dad... 
You must not remember anything. Come on.
How'd they get it inside?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Nine hundred...
I don't smoke?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Exactly.  And he got good.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
I'm not refuting anything.
Shhhhhh.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Who the hell is this "they?"
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Exactly.
No thanks.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
Oh.
Who?
No, not really.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes, I did.
What do you mean?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
That's up to you.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Just listen to them!
Mom, they're in a cage!
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Where would I get a boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
They're back!
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I know, Mother.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
You're doing fine.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
What good will they do?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
And locked it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Ahhh, but I know you.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Oh, no you don't!
Yes.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Certainly, but...
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
I wrote the letter.
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
Cheers.
What'll it say?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
No, thank you.
Of birds?
Hear!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
No, no...
Don't let's take any chances.
The bay doesn't.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Mitch...
What do you suppose it is?
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, all right, but...
I have no idea.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
Help how? What do you want to do?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Mr. Gray?
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Yes, I suppose so.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
The heart pumps it.
But what makes a thought start?
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long ago?
I'll get him.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
I'm looking for my friends.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
Your father gave them to both of you.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Shut up.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
It's not what you think.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Would you care to be more specific?
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Well, sure, but--
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
The present situation?
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
Is it real?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
I want to know what he told you last night.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
It won't work.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
He's a vampire alright.
Zero.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
Maximum body-count.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Hey, take it easy.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
How do you know they're not?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Sam, don't --
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
You have a T.V.?
Whatcha doin' over here?
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
Oh, no, you won't.
Okay.
I'm tired now.
Michael!...
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Entertain yourself.
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know.
The Marines.
Just listen.
Yeah.
So what's our problem?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Cut him loose?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
That's good enough.
Garry's missing!
For your health.
I think so.
Enough, MacReady!
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Bennings?
You reach anybody yet?
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Everything that's been missing.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Get your gear on.
So what do you make of it?
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Where?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Why did they built it?
How are your dreams now?
End...?
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
No, we created the Morlocks.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
You know I can't.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
I mean... well... affection.
Hold on... I know I have it...
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
We took a walk three days ago.
What?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
You wouldn't believe me.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Good night, Alex.
His home.
Thank you...
Sir...?
Thank you.
Your husband is dead?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I will...
Thank you...
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
I can see Kalen's point.
Or mud carriers.
Someone you loved very much.
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
May I get you some --
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
No...
They've gone to a better place.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
They're inside --
For our sake, I hope not.
Should we be...
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
What for?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
After I...
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I have no idea.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
It's Sunday.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
To the hospital.
Good. How's your mom?
I could try to...make it stop.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
You have no idea what's going on.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
I did?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What for?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Where are you going?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
No, I'm ok.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
How?
What.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
Why?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Oh, great.
Right.  Where are they?
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Who is it?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Oh yeah.
How come he let you go?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
But you think he fools around.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Taking a shower.
Lemme see the map.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
I want you to call Darryl.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Alright, Louise!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Yeah.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Well, you got it now.
We should have just ignored him.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Hit it.
Yeah.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
You're drivin'.
Pass him!
Does that mean suck my dick?
We've gone insane.
Why?
Go.
Say you're sorry.
Hi there!  You alright?
He implied it.
Good-looking?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Well... at least now you know.
What?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Huh.
People get hurt that way.
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
No I can't.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
I beg your pardon?
Lint?
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Huh... that's strange.
All you want is a phone number?
No.
Really?  Very, very?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Oh, uh, I resigned.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
That must make it tough.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
He's no Steve Young.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Just a minute.
And did everything -- ?
Really? I never got a message.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
I agree there should be more.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, come on...
Really.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Giddy-up.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Yes.
What if I can't?
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
That is correct.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
What about you? Where are you going?
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
I see.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
I got one up on ya.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
I gave it back to her.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He also said "listen to the water."
She's your sister?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Sorry.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Never mind.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
How the hell do you know?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I could be, too.
That's all!
Why not?
No.
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Anything.
You don't have to kill it.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Where'd you get it.
What?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
...Something like that.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
This is crazy!
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Okay, okay.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Just relax.
Is it you?
What do I want?
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Did what?
Got you here.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Just once, if they take your plane away.
What'd you do?
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
GOT 'EM.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
All right.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Thank you.
Identification?
May I use your pen?
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
There!  The woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Relax, you'll live longer.
I don't know.
Yeah.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Quit while you're ahead.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Lori, move.
Bye.
Doug...
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
Why would I lie to you?
I don't need Kuato for that.
Aliens built it.
It's just up ahead.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
That's the plan.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
You got that right.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
We got a plan!
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
It's...gone...!
You okay?
Good point.
An hour after you picked it up!
Please... I need to sleep...
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And one good guy.
Absolutely.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- Remember?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Want to tell me what went down here?
...Okay...
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
No, s-sir.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Albert.
Tell me some other things about her.
Get lost Bobby.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
The stuff we got last night.
Bobby...
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Out back in our morgue.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
You are here and there is no place to go...
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
How do you figure?
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Yes, he is like a clown.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
What can I tell you?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
What does Bob say?
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Boating?
Trees?
They were looking for wood.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
That's right.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
You thought it was just.
Yes.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
No.
Yes.
I... yes.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
...We did everything we could...
We just...
Hold on a second.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Why is that?
Yes.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Yes.
The most respected...
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
...that's perfectly all right.
Yes.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
I was held up.
I'm sure you would.
Defense...?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Listen to me, fella...
Are you done?
Mr. Concannon...?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Maybe what?
You're going to stay here...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
That's what I am.
I... do you want me to leave?
You, you don't under...
What are you going to do?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Thanks, Franky.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
They still have to take it to a jury.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't know.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
It was...  ...one of them!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Chase...
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase, it's Dylan!
What?  What kind of episode?
No.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Can you come with me in my dreams?
I'm fine.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
You're kidding, right?
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
What's that?
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
My child?  No...but...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I am about this.
We were idealists.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
What about you?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
It was a bad dream...
You only hurt yourself you know?
I guess.
I know enough.
We all have problems.
Look, I just better go.
Good.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Who?
What are you talking about.
Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand.  Raise the mainsail.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sir...?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
They have every right Chuck.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
We'll think of something.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
What's that?
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
What?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Sir.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
May I ask you something?
Why? He's right in the groove.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
Sorry to hear it.
No.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
What'd you say?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
What happened on the charges?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
...Asshole.
Come here.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
See ya downstairs.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
What brand'd she smoke?
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Hell, peanut...
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Where?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
It's a comfortin' idea.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
You think she's gonna make it?
Sailor?
Yeah?
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
Love you, too.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Went with Bobby.
Let's leave here.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
That's your business... I don't care how.
No.
Yes.
On one condition...
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
By who?
I know... I remember.
Well?...
Actually... I just want to go home.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He finished it Winter Break.
He is. Take my word for it.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Competence.
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
Her dog, yes.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
That's really it.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
What are we going to do with...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Is he all right?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Sure.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Colon cancer.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Kinship.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
I'm not going, with them.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Jesus.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Caps.
I love you, Grady.
Really? That was fast.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I told Walter.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Lucky guess.
James is... I don't know...
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Sick.
Taking the long way home.
Only when I'm working.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
No, the dog.
I haven't heard of half of those.
I doubt it, darling.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
How is she?
How old is Anna?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
Ah, come on.
Isn't it?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
The mother sure has her hands full.
It's just a city park.
How does it sound?
Try.
You should hear the bird.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
Why's that?
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
I can't.
Robin, listen to me.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Will I see you again?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
I'm not that crazy.
They usually tell me.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you want to happen?
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
That's not a helpful answer.
What?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I meant later... when you two took naps.
I thought you were a dyke.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What?
It's been a while since...
Is that all?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Twelve years in prison?
Depraved? My mistake.
You really believe that?
Bullshit.
Who doesn't?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
I'm switching off now.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
They'll come out after us.
I don't know, look around.
I don't know how!
Who then?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
No.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
But you just said that a month was too...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Four or five days.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
And why do you tell us this only now?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And what about you?
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Then why do you say them?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Why?
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Do you consider that a compliment?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
To the shark.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
No. The owners are in Australia.
From Panarea. Why?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
No.
Who tells you these things?
Yes, Mother.
For what?
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You've been alone together?
Would you like to talk about it?
Why do you smoke?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
How?
She tells you you're ugly?
And that you're stupid?
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
What?
Alright.
No I'm not.
I really love you.
Yes.
And why am I here?
Why?
Because I wasn't worthy.
May I open my eyes now?
We went to chapel for vespers.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
What?
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
Do you still go to church?
Yes... I...
Unfiltered.
I haven't a clue.
I am not with the Inquisition.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
Earthquakes?
Nothing.
Yes.
Oh, Dear God...
Your niece!
Yes.
I'd like yours too.
I know you don't.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Do you want to become one?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
The father!
Who is he?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Where is she?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Eh?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Spoil sport!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
But I won't.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Pity.
Out where?
Parading's better!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Here, Pauly.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Oh you are, I know you are.
I would have said so.
That's what you tell me.
Don't start. Look.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
You were twanging too loud.
Well, he can't stop here.
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
Is it solid?
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Take a look.
You want to try?
Can you see anything in the hole?
No, I want to go in.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Has the hull been breached?
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
What?
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
It wouldn't come.
Yes.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
My signal's fading.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Let's get moving with this net.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Yeah?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
With great pleasure.
Go ahead, Jay.
Nothing.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Kill me...
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Yeah...
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Yep...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Which mean physically going outside.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Check out the tent.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
You have to...
Phoebe.
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I am somebody.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Eddie what?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
We're?
You have no right to say such things!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Champion to champion.
That's not true!
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Then you two must have a long talk-
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Didn't you know?
Everything... everything's so funny...
I told her. I sounded off.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I'll check with Eve...
Cut it out.
That never stopped you before.
Twenty minutes!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Don't mix your metaphors.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Don't be condescending.
Margo, let's make peace.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Is it the money?
It's only one picture deal.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.
You're quite a girl.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
An answer.
Now you want an argument.
Late for what?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You were just looking around...
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Try...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Karen.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
Really, Eve? Why?
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
How far to the station?
Isn't that what they always say?
I just can't believe it.
You'll be there, won't you.
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Eve?
That was a pity...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
With gestures, of course.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
I never said it was!
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
When's the audition?
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Sure.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
We're inside the White House now.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
I've got a lot of energy.
Sure--off the record.
--so?
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Absolutely--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
It's right under that pile.
There's always a later plane.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
The ones who could disburse the money.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
I'm not your source on that.
--you double-checked both sources?--
I don't know titles.
--I'm not here.
Look, I told you inside--
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Haldeman too?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
James McCord.
Security consultant.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
It may never come out.
I couldn't say.
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
That was awhile ago.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Haldeman.  Right?
I won't talk about the other two.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Single malt?
Yep.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
You don't like it?
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
That's not why we're going out.
I think I've had one.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
I'll save you a seat.
Just in time.
Holy shit!
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Highly, highly overrated.
Okay, I get it.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
You've got something going?
I thought so.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
I think "shithead" really says it.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
But you don't love me.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Me too.
Yeah, right here.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
So... you feel okay now?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I know. He told me.
A cure?
I don't know...
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Really.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Trying... to... breathe...
You shouldn't have pushed us!
The dessert fork!
Sad?
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Shut up!
He's her?
Look!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
This guy's on television.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Who are you?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Do you feel all right?
Yeah? Allison what?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
The alarm clock.
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
M'hm...
Oh, yeah.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Fifteen years, yeah.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Really?
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
H'm?
Yeah?
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Oh.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Very big spider.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Oh! My God! 
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Remember that day?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Don't get upset!
I have a headache.
Jesus!
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Right before his un-American thing.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Look, uh...
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
There are no twos, Max.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
But she's colored.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
And here, you just-
A long time.
Oh yes.
It has your ring.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Oh.
Oh.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
You should have brought him.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
I love her too, Joe.
Anymore.
Just did.  Jealous?
She's in ICU.
Fuck you.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
Whatever you say.
Ryan's novel.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Okay, knock it off.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
He'll find his way back.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It's a novel.
About me!
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
It's a Calder.
I know.
Do I put you off?
Sally did all this herself?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
Okay.
Medallions.
And he doesn't smoke?
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Don't go in, Ryan.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
How long ago was it?
Yes.
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Yeah.
Will champagne help?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
What does that mean?
No.  Not something new.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
That's not an answer, is it?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
You're keeping a record, are you?
I don't mind...
Relax.  You've done enough.
Like Joe.
The both of you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You're right!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
No...as a matter of fact...
I order you to find out where we are!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Well I guess that makes us even.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Worker!  Come back here now!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Duty calls!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
ARREST HIM!
Yes, what else?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I'll be back.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Oh!
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Fine.  Wait.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I think so.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
The mirror -- it's broken.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
No -- it's my stomach.
A cemetery?
Gin.
No doubt about it.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Who'd care?
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
I don't want to talk to him.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
I guess so.
Might as well go all the way.
You usually eat alone?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
Cheers.
Mind if I come in?
In there.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Last night?
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
I'm not through with you yet.
How would you like to go tonight?
I am?
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Naturally.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
You threatening me?
Me?
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Well, I have things to do --
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
Family?
No kidding.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Get more coffee.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I want you back, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Handle what?
Are you sure that's what you want?
I love you -- remember?
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
The nerve.
I told you -- with my mother.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
We need all our fuel.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
No -- absolutely not --
Moonby what?
Tracks ?
How long were you up there ?
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Yes, sir --
Call me what, sir?
Whatdoya think it thinks.
I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
Yeah -- like keep out --
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
About what ?
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
What?
Boss left.
What do you mean?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
Yes.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
When?
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
That's me.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Well , who's in command here?
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
26   CONTINUED:  
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
How many do you see?
Hate to disappoint you.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Get the fuck out of here.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
You met the gift.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Just how grateful I am.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Now I want you to do something for me.
The stiff one eye?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you still coming?
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
No.
Dancing?
And?
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
It's one idea...
To hell with sex.
Yeah... Well...
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Cute.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Because...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
What a nice compliment.
Good night.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Two years ago...
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Come on, sweetheart...
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Yeah.
How long have you been freelance?
We both know what you were doing.
We go around once.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
Why don't you tell me.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
I work for the government.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
He wants to kill you?
Forget it!
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
The C.I.A.?
Jesus -- why?
The exotic women.
That's fiction.
You said you didn't trust it.
About?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
But he won't shoot you right then?
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
What did he want?
I didn't notice them.
I went into their room this afternoon.
Did he explain how this happened?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Both.
Did you --
When did it start?
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Why not?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Right.
You mean quit?
That's correct.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
You got my word on it.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And put it on expenses?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
So?
I thought that was part of the charm!
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
'cause you stink of booze.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Have you ever stolen anything?
They'll never get us.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
They ain't the only ones.
Now you're using that word.
Lucky break!
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
What are you talking about?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Yes.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
You're everything a guy could want.
Don't worry it's okay!
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But we could go to London and live in England.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Great....How long will it go for?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
How?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
How do I know what's being said?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Yeah, but it was okay.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
No problem, is it at your place?
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
I'm sorry about how we --
I don't want his money.
He wants to show now.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
That'd be something.
Me.
I don't want to have any conversation.
Good thing.
You want to tell me...
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
I'm really glad you think so.
Yes. And?
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
That sounds like horseshit.
I don't want to be just your friend --
What?
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
That what you do?
Nothing.
Now? We just --
I don't want to come here anymore.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
Scalene?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
What do you want, Biff?
Yeah. Maybe so.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Oh yeah.
Good.
Lemme see that.
Why what?
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
March 11th.
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
What if you lost your keys?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Curious... Very curious....
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What did you do to yours?
He said not to tell.
She plays the clarinet, too.
I'll catch up with you.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Thirty aught six.
Nope.
Sure thing. Come on.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Spanish.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
What?
But it would hurt.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah.
Yes.
No.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Git.
Then that's it!
Planet 10?
Now!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
You look!  It's not here!
Damn John Whorfin--!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Better than him.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
...I know this must look... funny.
...Who is this?
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
...Huh? No, I'm –
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Well not much.
No, what did it say?
What do you mean, Barton?
Can be. Not easy, but –
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
Charlie. How are you.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
So they say.
No... no...
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
Anyway.
But, you know, with the head still on.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Yeah.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
I don't need any help.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
I had him in two classes.
What?
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
Did you go home with him?
I loved him.  I hurt.
No, thanks.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
No.
I'll meet you there.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
No.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
No thank you.
Did you ever tie him up?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Not now he don't.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
I don't believe it.
Is he dead?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Do you still love her?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Sure, ok..
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Good. What do you have?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
What who's saying?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Staten Island would be ok.
You're your own baby.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I need this?
Uh-oh!
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Wrong on both counts.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Things change.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Photojournalist.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I recognized the accent.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Mr. Freeze.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
Just the beast.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
From the other side of the equator-
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Then you never loved me?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
What did you say?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What?
Mystery.
Tonight's a good night.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
And you are?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Wait. You can't go.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
On occasion. Usually at night.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What do you know about obsession?
To kill me.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't want to remember!
You do know. Try.
What are you talking about?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
Who is it?
How could I forget?
Let's see if you bleed green.
You sunk my battleship.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
... A hundred and eight?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
No one would miss me.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
It's gone.
I said I'd check with you.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Did you really ask?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Sort of half.....
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Thanks, Annie.
What?  What?
oh dear.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
And a car.
Well, there is that ...
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
What's your problem Beavis?
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
You mean there's mre than one?
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
D.C., Chief.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Life is just... too awful.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Yes.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Any particular kind?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Attic space.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Why not?
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
An attorney?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
No, Robert.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
I have no idea...
Oh. I have a message for him.
A Black man gave me the message.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Our greenhouse.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
I see.
I agree.
Yes, I understand.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. You look very sick.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Yes. That is correct.
No, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
... Oh.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I live here.
No.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Correct.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Yes, I will.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... Would you take me on a tour?
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
No, sir.
That could be possible...
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The ferret?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Why?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
What?
Us, of course.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
People make mistakes.
I said "yes."
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
You married?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
You can be John Malkovich.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
A scary dream?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
I love you, Lotte.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Who needs dancing?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Not like He punished me.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
In case of what?
No. I mean work work.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
I don't want to know.
She was only-
Yeah. Look bad?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Make it the way I always do.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
But I guess she told Dieter.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Yeah, it sucks.
That is for the urn.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Huh?
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
What's that, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Uh-huh.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Separate incidents?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
But he's--
I want a child.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Huh?
Wooden bridge, huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
The bulk of the series.
Look, man, did you--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
No Dude.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Is this a--what day is this?
Well. . . yeah.
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
Why?
What do you really think?
I'll show you.
Blood...
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
You experimented on your own, son?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Wait.
I don't buy it.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Take him.
You're blind --
Show me.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
You used me as bait?!
There is no cure.
For your miracle cure?
Some. It's been slow --
I've been better --
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
No --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I was afraid that might happen.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Join the club.
--Anna--
Nick!!
What're you doing there?
--he's not my husband!
--a six week bun in the oven--
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
We've looked at half of one tape.
--Cotter's--
I guess, yeah.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I can't.
Why?
I know, I know.
I don't know yet.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
What? That made her lose the baby?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Still don't see it--
Gimme it!
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Next time try putting on shoes--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
No one ever comes here.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Okay.
Sure. I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Yeah.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
What happened to my Dad??
What was that?
I just gotta see a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Yeah...
...Hell.
Well what?
That's not the point.
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Can I feel 'em?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Yes.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
See my breasts?  . See?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
. same here.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
You called me Jeffrey.
My secret lover.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Terrible. boring.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Let's go.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yes.
Who, me? Why should it?
What am I going to do?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Shoot.
Jeffrey!!
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
This is it.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
You'll see for yourself.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
No.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
What's that?
Not really, no.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Yeah.  You do the talking.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
This is not the time, Diego.
What?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I did not.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Coke.
In how long?  A week?
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Keep them coming.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
I meant every word of it.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
Dad.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I swear.  On my life.
I swear on your life.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Dien Bien Phu?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Not enough.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
No, and neither were my men.
I'm trying.
You got something on the coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Thanks, Mister D.
Did I say it was a natural death?
The official cause?
No.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Yes.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Yes.
She left me.
What did she say?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Why?
No.
Yes.
I was angry.
That's all Dr. Paley.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Do you remember his exact words?
Yes -- cocaine.
No.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
Then you would have gotten your money?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Hi.  It's Frank.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I went out on the boat.
You can see me now.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I know. I don't understand it either.
What?!
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Not this kind of heat.
I don't mind waiting.
Sure.
Must be nice having kids.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
I think so.
You sound like an artist.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying --
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
How about if I set the table?
Sure.
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Trouble. Why?
What?
Yes, thanks.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Stop it!
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHY?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Betty.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I don't remember!
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
How did you get in here?
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
That place is already bad luck.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Patrick, he's...
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
But the place burned to the ground.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
Where's what?
Stay away!
I can't.  I can't.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
The money?  The money's gone.
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar ...
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
We're going to need some time.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I'm listening.
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Oh, right.
Go right ahead, sir.
Good idea.
Five.
I should be going.
Are you okay, Violet?
What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Leave your phone on the hook.
All right.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
A favor?
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
He said you lost something.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Basically.
The redistribution of wealth?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Even though he knew about you?
For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
Yeah.
Who is Gino?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
He does it right in front of him.
What did Gino drink?
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I'm still here.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Yeah, I know...

-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
It's a little late for that.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
What does that mean?
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Where are we?
Looks familiar?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I trusted you.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
What's that?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
I don't remember Zurich.
...aven't you?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
You must save the day.
You don't have to sing it.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Well, I ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Jack!
Ah ...
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Not really, no.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Tell me about Layton.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
A terrorist?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
I do. Goodbye. 
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
No.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
Every day?
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Are you sure?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Oh my God, a mistake!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Next of kin!
Here.
Don't mention it. See you later.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
What! Shit!
Sam Lowry.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
What? Who is this?
Have you got one or haven't you?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
No. Wait here.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
Mary ...
Where is she?
I should be going. I just quit.
Just take it easy.
You're going to live.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
I know him. That's Noel.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Did you see my father?
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Don't seem so bad to me.
Fifteen minutes.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
That's too many.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Greatest job in the world.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
I've taken that into consideration.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You really think so?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Nice, Jane.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Oh, God, no!
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You too.
Then it went well.
I lost six pounds...
Speaking.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
No.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I trust you.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Uh-uh.
That's not it.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
What?
It's okay.
Then you should stay here.
A picnic?
You're saying stay away from him.
I'm going home!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
N-no...
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Me too.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Better!
Are you ready?
That means you like me!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Now what kind of statue was that?
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Didn't you hear him?
I said I did, didn't I!
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
They are?
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Huh?!!!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
You are?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Well I'm overjoyed.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Good morning Walter!
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
With Dead Cat?
Then let me give you something then...
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
We hate you guys!
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Let me in.
Get away from here.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Which way did she go?
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I thought we were meeting here.
You left me a message?
It could happen.
Buffy.
You want some water or something?
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
For the dance.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
I'm looking for you, actually.
To bring you... your birthright.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Why do you keep saying that?
Oh, him.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
My nails.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
A what?
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Vampires of the world, beware.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
That's the plan.
Thank you very much.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Well, I hope so.
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You said "Crash".
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Big League pitchers don't use these.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
My right nostril?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
A little better.
Just till I lose.
I'll tuck you in.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
it's okay..
You don't have to...
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
I doubt that.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
Praise the Lord, eh?
Never heard of 'em.
Will that work for me?
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
I thought I was--
Well, I held it like an egg.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
God--what a Big League move.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
You're the boss.
What do I gotta do?
Boring.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
You fuck!
No.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Take the first shot at me.
Hit me in the chest with this...
We'll be praying for you.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
Can I give you my testimony?
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Where does he go?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
You were wandering around.
But what happens when they do find out?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Hey!
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
All right, Ace?
No, I don't wanna come -
You lost your control.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
All right.
Yeah.
Hey, she came to talk...
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
I just told you. She called me.
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
How do you do?
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
No problem.  Sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Good to meet you.
Half of everything is mine.
...position...
...and she doesn't always -
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
I'll be right back.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
No, you don't.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
He needed some clothes.
I bought him a watch too.
I was with somebody.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Fuck you.
You understand? What? Let you go?
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
I am not!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Not gonna let me in?
Bullshit! Bullshit!
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
I really think you're -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Shut your mouth!
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Now move along.
Is that the last one?
We're waiting on Carmine.
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
How are you?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
And how are things going down there?
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
All right?
Oh, come on.
Let me think about that.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
A sponsor.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Okay, yeah.
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
God... I wish you...
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
Every night, on the couch.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
They'll do it.
Yeah.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Denying?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I don't know. I can't remember.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
You're serious?  You'd help me...
I lied.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Wha-at?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
You've seen me...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Ask me another one--
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Stop.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Uh. "Thanks?"
Yeah, she's okay.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I actually got some memory back last night.
You turned around!
Like you don't know...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Maybe.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Taking messages.
I didn't hurt you.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Then whose is it?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Will you let me explain!
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
A woman?
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Not a chance.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Did you hear that click?
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Yes sir.
Put the man back on.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Whose money is this?
The guy with the transplant.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Assure them that you're being well treated.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
You were at the Emerald that night?
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
Did you hear that?
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
Think you could do a picture of me?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
Naturally.
Only one way to find out.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Didn't we play this scene before?
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Talk to the man.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Don't worry.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Put the girl on.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
In your dreams.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Seems not.
Let me talk to the lady again.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
From here on, I dish it out.
Thanks.
Then why doesn't she?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Now, that was a look.
Persistent.
You fucking did.
Who the fuck is he?
Charming.
Fuck off back to Essex!
He wants to know do I mean that.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
The accent, I suppose.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
No, I didn't --
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Are you jealous of him?
I think you do.
Do I?
Depends what it is.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
I have to talk to her, Col --
Sorry, darling.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
Know what, honey?
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Okay.
Not here.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You got the keys to the shop?
Yes.
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Did you hear me?
You didn't.
Don't you want to kill me?
You do?
Fergus.
What happened to Jimmy?
Yes. Now.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
That's wise, Tommy.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Some judge...
I sincerely hope so.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
It's your decision.
I told him.
Yes.
I understand.
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
I seen your fucking face.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
I'm not a gambling man.
No, what's the funny thing?
Absolutely not.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Take her picture. C'mere.
Stop it --
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
What does that mean?
Tell me something, anything.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You shut your face --
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
No -- I guess not.
What about it?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Well -- come on.
Yes, you told me.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
We? You mean you're --?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Agents.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
No, thank heaven.
Starting with his own.
What's your first name today?
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Sure.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
You did.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
No --
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Shut the door!
I don't think I know that one.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
How much is it worth?
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
What's its value today?
And the last one?
Why bother him?
What do you want?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
I found it! I found it!
We won! We won!
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Oh. I guess.
Is your husband with you?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
How did you find out?
I don't know where to go.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
The man and the woman are married --
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
What your husband was mixed up in.
How about once more around the park?
Good night.
What?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Va jouer, mon ange.
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
We will separate -- you look over there.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Not my imports.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
So?
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
She works at a church?
Can you get inside?
What?
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Of course I'm scared.
Who?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
I was desperate. It was gross.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What party?
No.
Stag?
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Don't you think it's sick?
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
I heard you got attacked.
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
I love you.
Did he say anything else about her?
Not that I know of.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Did you want one?
Hide your laptop here.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Where's Sam?
Where do you want this stuff?
Since today.  New policy.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Oh.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...and a shitload of ice.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
For cryin' out loud.
Peace.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
It happens to this piece of shit...
Do you wanna give me a minute?
You stole this truck! That's...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Hey.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
...-damn!
Okay. 
Oh...
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Kiss my ass!

...I believe in live and...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...truck!
...man!

Okay. 
Oh, shit.
Come on!
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Hey!
These'll keep it cold.
I'm crazy?


Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
You know what I'm sayin'?
...or nephew or some good old boy...
So you took his...
So I took his truck, yeah.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...miles.
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...

They're movin'.
What?
 Come on!

Okay. 
Hang...
Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!
...here comes the...
 


 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
You.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Be cool.  Be--
I'll keep an eye out.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...

We've got it...
Hold it!
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...-tor Long.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
"Went away."  I like that.
...happen if I drop this?
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
I wanna patch in from...
Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
You know the suspect?
Richard Long.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
...-tainer!


...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Uh, we both like to fish.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
EXT. DAM - DAY.

After that re-...

...is a perfect hunter.

...and that power...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

 No...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
That's not the way I...
...public drunkenness....
Then how about if I call you "ass-...
...we're all gonna die in this...
I'll lead 'em out.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.
Row twenty-three, section C.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Oh yes.
Would you call him a capable man?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
My daughter.
How did you find out?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Okay.
Thank you...
But what?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Or her name?
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
What are you having?
What do you mean?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
And Hollis knew about it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...No. Why was it.
The Albacore Club.
I saw him.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Sure.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
...where does Kyo live?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
I'm sorry, I --
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yes...
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Do you know me?
That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
When it comes.
So how are you, Morty?
Of course not.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
So I can have these? 
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
But you don't have any kids!!!
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
No, nobody came. 
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
That's all there is.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
I'll write it myself.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
There is no news big enough.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Emily, you -
Charles.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
How old did you say you were?
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
At night?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Susan, I really think -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Susan!
I'm not sorry.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Why not?
What's wrong, Brad?
Brad, you are drunk.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Yes.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
That's the train with all the lights.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
How do you do, Charles?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Good!
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
Think again!
What do you mean?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Am I sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Unnhh!
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
You can hold me down.
Exactly.
I'll try to manage.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
It's not what you think.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
So you're really getting married?
Look how full of yourself you are.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
I'll assess all I want!
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
I thought Redding had like three balls!
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Five years.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Blasphemy.
How do you mean?
So?
Each egg has to be perfect.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Sorry.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Number six.
What!?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I can't close the store.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Broke his neck.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Who found him?
Why should I loan you my car?
What?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I like to expand my horizons.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
Leave me alone.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Make them change.
Lovely story.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
I'm her sister.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
No, she's getting married.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
I'm not dealing.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Meaning?
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
At least they weren't lit.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're a pig.
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
Yeah, right.
You sucked his dick!
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Lower your voice!
A few?
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
...it isn't there. Yes.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
What time do you get finished?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No, I wasn't.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Screw you!
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I'll see you there.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You're not?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye  That was Snowball.
That woulda been cool.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Six...
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
A flare up...
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
You got to go back now!
Where's Hal, what's going on?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Yeah, let's go.
Making things real rough for Hal.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
I burned it.
How far?
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
What did you do that for?
You bastards... bastards.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
Won't you join me, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
How do you do, sir?
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you, sir.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Murder, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Brown hair, is it?
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Vitamins will it be then?
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Fine. Fine.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Oh.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
I've done my best, have I not?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
What?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
But not now?
Sure thing.
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Did better'n that.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
What?  What did you say?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
I brought you flowers.
I'm standing right here.
I was just tryin' to...to...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
What?
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
Who was he?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Am I collateral?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
What difference does it make?
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
No.
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's the reason?
As in...? 
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Any special reason?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
You turned up a one way street!
Look, I'm sorry --
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
No.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
You bit someone's nose off?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You saved my life.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I have no idea.
Are these yours?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Pretty scary, huh?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Realized what?
Where then?
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Is that what they told you?
What about you?
You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
A dog bit it.
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
A dog.
Working.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Oh?  How's he doing?
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
And?
How can that be?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
And a hundred mile airspace.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
So who...?
The librarian... or the library...?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
No more stalling, Captain.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Mmm.  Look closer.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Any luck on the grant money?
Actually --
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
But the work --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Like it or not.
What day?
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
If you came back.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Oh.  I brought you something.
Maybe that's okay.
I'm sorry.
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
In other words.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
I'll make it a dollar.
Buck is a deal.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Ram it in and break it off!
You steal a car?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Innocent?
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
What you mean, Luke?
All the bears gonna be walking today.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I think this is number three...
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
They get fan letters...
Let me get a little action started here.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
She on the passenger side?
Go and look for a note.
Michael Johnson.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Classy madonna.
You came in there with this attitude...
My promise.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Thank you.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
One of your suitors?
One of my suitors.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
You could get your wish at any moment.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I want to see my mother immediately.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Oh?
And the party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
You've only known Jake a few months.
Mom, please.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Tomorrow?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Mom, please.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
There's a spider in my room.
No.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
No.
No rounds for another three hours.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
List schmist. You'll remember.
It's sex time.
No.
Shhhh.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
How about a dance?
I think I should call someone.
Letty, please.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Can you loan me a 20?
I think you're overreacting.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
That's a load off my mind.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I'm glad you're doing well.
Office work?
I'll float you.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Do you know who this is?
Wired?    I ain't wired.
A pass.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
It's Elvis...
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
No thank you.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Why are you here?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
I assume you want something?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
I'm not any closer than you are.
What about the money?
No.
Do I?
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Can I trust you, Sami?
I will.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
You said don't do it, boss.
Everything.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Yes.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This kind.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
We both know I'm already dead.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

Give it to me, Sami.
I said a clean break.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Where is it, Sophie?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
What does arresting us get them?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
It's for you.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I didn't have the heart.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
What's it to you?
You're already a thief.
I owe you nothing.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
How so?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
You know about Lo?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
So what will you do now?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
What about you?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
I dabble.  May I?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Is he inside?
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Forever.
Okay...
Why not?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Because you act like a pig.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
You don't even know me.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
How about tonight?
How was your date?
I will.
Oh please.
Fine.
No?
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
That's not fair.
Why can't we be together?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
I don't think that bothered him.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are you scared of?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
What are you saying?
No.
Did you hide the letters?
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Why didn't you do something?
What do I do then?
He'll love it.
No.
Same time next week?
Would you please leave.
Baby?  Right on time.
One.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
What?
You don't mean?
Loser.
Call me later.
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Who are you spying on?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
What's your problem?
Where'd she go?
No, tell me.
Well done.
I accept. Now get out.
And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Is that so?
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I'll do that.
I did?
Don't worry about it.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
She was very pretty.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I didn't forget.
Certain wishes do.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
For as long as you'll let me.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
That's right!
But we don't have any sea weed.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
It stands so still.
Don't cry, Amy.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
That's a fine-looking ring.
But she's such a nice lady.
It got hit.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Don't you read Shakespeare?
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
At Victoria's Secret.
Oh, on my wrist.
Does she have PMS?
Anything's better than Mark.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
No. I don't think so.
And my bra finally fits again.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
About Mark? Carlton?
Frida? You okay?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I really gotta pee.
Yeah right... You better go.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Very well then. Is that all?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Like what?
Briefs.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Okay, you busted me.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
What? Is there someone else?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Worse than this?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, take it.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
You're some catch Lloyd.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Put it through...
What?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Your name is John White.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Just don't call him, Alan!
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Oh.  Fine.
I don't think so.
You could buy it on payments.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Oh my gosh...
In the car?
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
She knows.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
I'm outta here.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
You weren't in the state legislature.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Truman used it all the time.
It's just so strange...
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Me, too.
What about the intro?
All set.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Ain't no place safe.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
MARY!
I don't think they're in school.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I'm sorry.  I, we
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
That's not my fault.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Knox?!
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
A barbaric yawp.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Then you can help him.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Yes sir.
But different.
What?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
But if he said no before then...
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
From my father and Nolan.
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
What the hell are you talking about?
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
I have a schedule...
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
How do you know that?
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Nowhere...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
She fucked me too.
Get the boots.
I know, but...
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Who? Who is?
She does not!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
You mean...?
Yeah.
No.
No, I --
I came to see Merle.
Where is he???
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
I don't know.
I... No. You do this for money?
I know.
Huh?
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
What do you think about?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
I'm doing that too.
You wanna bet?
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
I gotta get back, Nick.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Here. Behind you.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Yeah.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
No.
Never one.
Down ribbon!
I'd think about it.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
You're crazy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
You sure?  I can help you.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Pass.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Drop it.
I was set up.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Hey, I'm eating.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
What else did he get?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
And you should be with your family.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Anybody can see that.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
That's just too bad --
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
No. She's gone.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Well, I'll be -- 
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Look here now--
Leave your tongue off of that!
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Why not -- ?
How much?
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Who is it?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Oh -- Jabez.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Hard luck -- like me.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
What's that?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
So, why didn't you come?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Tell me about it.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Two?  Are you sure?
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
I'm here, cowboy.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Listen.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Heidi, I'm dying.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
They're not after you, they're after me.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
It looks like a whole roast.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Ooohh....
Yeah.  So how are you?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Would you do something for me? Please?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Look... who's on the phone?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
They were ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Well, they go to guard school.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Why not?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Hey.  It's raining.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, not until after they killed him.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You're serious!
We won't have to.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
We'd kill ourselves.
Okay.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
They're beautiful ...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
No!
Did Pop come down?

I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

Did it hurt?

That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.

Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Ask Sal.
No, you the man.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
How old are you?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Sal's gonna be mad.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
What are you so worked up about?
Sorry, comb got caught.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Motherfucker you.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
What is?
It's a motherfucking shame.
Yes you did.
Can't do.
Tonight, when we close.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Shit!  I forgot.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Magic Johnson.
We're outta here.
He's right.
I know.
So what do you want me to do?
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Then we could try something else.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
I'm fine.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
So boys, how was your first day?
Is that what I think it is?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Exactly! A pirate!
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
I didn't know that.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
They can't be real.

Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!

Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.

LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
I'll talk to you later.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Uh-oh. Harry?
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
I reckon so.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Everything. Just for the record.
What papers?
Are you going to kill her?
Piter.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated.

Huh?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
That's good.  I could use the money.
I don't know how to make goulash.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Formaldehyde.
Eddie, how was I?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Rolling.
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
What do you mean?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Toss us out on our ass.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
We're escaping!
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Maybe it needs special handling.
The marriage already ended.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
STOP!
Who's Dr. Tom?
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
Yes!
What octopus motor?
So how long have you known Eddie?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
I'm directing.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if I'm vomiting?
At what point?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
No.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You know what would be great?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
I want you to take this.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.

Really? They were..
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Your brother's here.
Hey, he cheated on her.
Oh my God!
Both.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Ma...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Shari, Ray feels --
Well, when will she be back?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
No, I mean...
You batted or you bunted?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Oh... how come?
Leave. Go.
I missed you.
Yeah, well...
Where?
The what?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What is?!
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
What?
Why do you do that?
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Who's --
No. Am I supposed to?
Ed... I'm sorry.
Do you still have it?
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Good?
Ed?
Yeah. Why?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
That's the point -- this could change things.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
But, Mr. M. -
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Doing what?
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Door was open.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
You sure?
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
It's not what you think.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Yeah.  But not for long.
We talked.
In the morning.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Dudley, what do you want?
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Of course... But how?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What was that boyfriend's name?
She told you?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
<u>Lynn</u>.
What about him?
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
That's right.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
More.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
I never truck with no sissies!
I don't own no shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Get on it.
I'll break them, sir.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Something like that.
What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Decorated?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Lynn Bracken.
Not good enough.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Right now, before I back down.
Officer White?
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
What's wrong, Trash?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
You're not.
Listen--
Turn on CNN.
I don't know who he is.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
The NSA killed him.
Where?
<u>Here</u>?!
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Not particularly, no.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Pardon?
<u>What's</u> your point.
The robbery.
Uh-oh.
You should take this seriously.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
What do you mean?
Have you been working with Rachel?
Sorry.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
Yeah...look--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
I know.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Never.
Yes.
Other than me.
You got a minute?
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
It's not me?
--otherwise we may have to--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Why?
Usually they take clothes.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Yes.
Jesus.
I have a family.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
I honestly don't know.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He's clever. He had help.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Yes sir.
You sing.  All the time.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
No.
It's a folk song.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
You bastard, I was believing you!
Shall we be all right?
Would you let me pass?
I can't move.  I can't get out.
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Sorry, what's your point?
Do you have your papers, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I told you so.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I don't know.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Don't cut me.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Rabbit hunting.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Please don't creep around this house.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Well, she is!
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I can already see.
Because I'm a nurse.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Really?  That's sudden.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
You loved him.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Oh God.  Oh God.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Does he have to go?
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I don't think so.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Through a window.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
How close?
Uh. I'm showing off.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
You...you can't.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
That's my girl.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
Good morning.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Our equipment has arrived.
Yes you did.
Aren't we all.
The Mask.
It's your mistake.
A billion dollars.
Okay, 80-20--
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's where the Mask comes in.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Call it a new tradition.
My god--
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Because it pays off.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
That's a joke, right?
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
What's your point?
They did?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Five million dollars?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Bullshit, you don't.
Good.
Don't bother.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Erin --
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
<u>No</u>.
No --
What do you mean?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Not in my world.
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
So why would PG&E offer it?
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Erin?  What are you --
I did.  Both.
How do you know that?
Right.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
I guess I did.
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Whose number do you need?
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Ten?
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Right.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
What do you mean?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
How would you know?
Nothing.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
What's going on?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
What is it?
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
Sit down, and shut up!
Does Luke know?
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Would you please stop calling me that?
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
I do not!
But the tremors have stopped.
That depends.  Where are we?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Repairs ...
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
What are you talking about?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
Never.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Good God.
I like you.
Dream on, blue eye.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Having second thoughts?
Yeah, I got it.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Thank you.
So be it.
Without Lancelot?!
And you cannot love me...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Me?
I will run.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Fuck it.
Hi, how'd your day go?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Yes, I go now.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Captain Howdy.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Damien Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I came to say goodbye.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
No now.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
Save your servant
Amen
O'Lord hear my preyer.
Amen
And let my cry come unto thee.
What's this about?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
No I probably wouldn't.
Is that a threat?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Are you tired?
...Be gone!!
Who is it?
Give me the keys!
It's my goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
Take it now.
Honey ...
Baker.
How will he eat?
Get your hand off me.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
That's not the point.
Lotta water.
Jack...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Try the black Knable.
You'll see.
Yeah, okay.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
That's what we agreed.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Right.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What?
Couple years.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
So what'd you think?
All right.
Yes, it is.
What about me?
We ran long.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
Hey!
Uh... good.
Right.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Virgins?
Yeah.
Well then ... shall we?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Is that important?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
I'll call you.
Baker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Pretty much.
Not for money. With my mother.
The Stratford.
Huh?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Forget it.
Every year.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Friend.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Sure.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
What's a prom?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
I'm not the same person you remember.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Let me have a look.
A few blanks?  Like what?
How come?
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Don't hang up ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Pollux is -- what?
Janie?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I'm not going anywhere.
Call me spontaneous.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Adelle?
I can see that, Alan.
Great room...
It’s just two kids, right?
You’re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
How’d you know my name?
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Give me my goddamn life back!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh huh...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
Because you’ll be here.
Uh huh...
That is the general idea, yes...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
How do you even know about this place?
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I’ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Think bigger.
Annie goes to a great school.
That’s the one...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Yes!
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Give me a mirror...
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Baby, you're scaring me.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
You've been working out.
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Last one down springs for room service.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Blockhead started it!
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Sure.
Reed, we're running out of time.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Are you kidding?
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
You can't leave them out there.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
Message to Proteus.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
We must!
But big enough for us...
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I have no idea.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
What gives you that idea?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
What's that?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Oxygenation...
It's too late!
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Where we going?
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
Drop that fucking money!
What's this, sir?
I don't think so. It's nice.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
No.
We split that.
Okay.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
You have children?
Where'd you get him that parka?
Yah.
Yah, right-o.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Ya kiddin'!
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Stan Grossman called.
...Is everything okay?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
The heck d'ya mean?
Call 'em up.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Linda Cooksey?
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Yah.
Thanks, hon.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Not on your feet too much?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
He's at Norstar.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Oh.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Practicing what?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I want that.
Deal.
I suppose.
What... ?
What the hell are you doing here?
Good.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Whatever.
When?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Marla, no, wait...
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
... You know me?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
No, I...
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Surprise me.
Strange.
This fight, pussy.
What car?
Good answer.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Promise you won't.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
I thought you did.
What are you doing?!
What?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
"Training?"  Tyler...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
I'm not going...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Paraffin.
Proceed with remote detonation.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
You're welcome to join our club.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
You were there?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
I have to save Eugene!
Taken care of.
Blow me.
Who?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
What?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Who is this guy, anyway?
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
That it's not over yet.
Who am I, David Blane?
He's not a witch.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Don't do it! Don't do it!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I know who you are.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
No one's that strong.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
Star Wars?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
No.
You stopped.
Read you.
Where's your stuff?
There's a compass in the handle.
Fermented fish sauce.
American?
Duck soup.
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
I thought he was with you.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
How?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
We just take pictures?
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Nice work.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
Those men are all dead.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Yeah!
Got any more bread crust?
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Thank you very much.
My agent.  I called my agent.
Thanks.
No, it's not... Come here...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Yes... I... I agree...
Fine.  I'll say no.
I was nine in the sixties.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
How much?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Great place huh?
Sshhhh!
They said you're The One.
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
It's a classic.
Bingo!
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
I know!
Fuck you.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
Got any Ethel Merman?
No, I...
Twinky?
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
That's right, hand.
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm going on over there...
I know you're not.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
No.
What?
Palm Apodaca.
Five'll do it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Well, you seem very professional...
Hi, Tita.
No kidding.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
He's had two strokes.
Don't tell me about this...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
A couple of months.
It's not that bad.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Swimming?
I didn't have any.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
What?! I can't hear you!
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
At game, Carl.
I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
You're all full of shit!
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
It's a Borzoi.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
I hope I didn't hear that.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
Well, I should hope not...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Perhaps...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Wussup.
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I did.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Wussup, Victor.
No, Baruch.
She lives near Eddie?
Um, yeah I think so.
You here to see somebody?
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
What?
Creasy, how old are you?
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
It was planted on me, sir.
Thank God, the police.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Your aunt?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
You don't know me.
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I agree.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Right.
Since he moved to L.A.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to murder me.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Sure.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Shoot.
No problem, boss.
Yeah.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
I'm sorry?
How long have they been married?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
See what I mean?
Down boy.
I saved his life during the war.
It's amazing.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Muchas gracias.
Lock's busted.
Moved out.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Looks great.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
I was upset.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Of course.
In a minute!
I said, I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Did she tell you anything?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Contacts.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Three hundred.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Peachy.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Who cares?  I got a case.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
The case!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
Fuck me...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's funny, you're cute.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
What?
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Everything is everything.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Who's this --
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
We must follow it.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Des Moines.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Darling, may I have this one?
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
What are you saying?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
They around?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
You're shitting me!
Baltimore?
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
You alright?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I know.  He loves that thing.
I'm serious.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Luck, my ass.
How's that?
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
Tell me.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
What?  What is it?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
How?
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
What...
Huh?
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
It's Friday the 13th.
Don't do that to me!
Why?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Somebody was in here.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
In that little thing?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Yes.
Keep looking.
Maybe.
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
Whaddya mean?
I could swear I heard...
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Please don't do anything crazy.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
He bought you that?
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
But...wait a minute!
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Not another word, do you hear me??
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Oh dear God...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
But Sean said...
What about not-so-great writers?
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
But I didn't get you one...
I'd love to.
What do you mean???
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
You are going where?
I don't want to hear about it.
Don't talk like that.
We must abandon.
I'm not ready.
That was a big mistake.
He'll hate it.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
She was very evasive.
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
It can't be all that personal.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
That's completely crazy.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Two-all after six.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
This could be it!
Where the hell are you?
They're only gonna lose.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Oh yeah?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
I want to believe.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Matthew.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Eleventh inning. What else?
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Sidney.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
One more time.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Is it true?
Where are you going now?
It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
It was one incident.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Even as a boy I thought so.
I would rather march.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's when you take advantage.
So did I.
Ahh.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
You had to be a right-hander.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Where?
In a corridor.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
They'll recognize me.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Good choice.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Michael's.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Where are you going?
There's a way.
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Where?
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Good.
It's just been a while.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
... and live happily ever after.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Like what?
El Paso.
I'll be ready.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Who was it?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Where we go in1?
Why not?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
You serious?
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
And you told Brumby?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did he say?
Was he?
What name?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
What?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Sure I'm sure.
Was it Albert?
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
Oh, what you doing now?
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
Where's that?
At the Half Moon.
Right.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
My brother, Frank.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Do you want breakfast?
Funny, that.
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Yes.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Shut up.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You did?
I, I...I...
Eh?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
No.
You...
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Yes.
As a robbery.
Did you talk to Graff?
A buck a shot.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Yes.
What does that mean?
What if you don't get caught?
Why would they come to me?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Me?
That's none of your fucking business...
You went for it.
In the abstract...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Thieves.
Why?
Yes.
You...
In school.
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Are you talking to me?
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Murray said...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Good.  Now we're talking.
No.
Yes, I am.
You robbed the office.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
That's right.
Last night, this morning.
"Always be closing..."
...yes...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Sure.
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
Yes.
Mmmm...
Three days.
What was yesterday?
No.  She told me "right now."
No, Jim.
What...?  Say the words.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
It's nothing.
What are the police doing here...?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Some of them...
It went down.  I filed it.
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Do you like them?
They were friends.
Just a few days.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
What can we do?
Yes, thank you.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
No, Dad.
You would risk your life for strangers?
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
He is weak.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
We have time.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
 And he agreed?
Am I a prisoner?
Kay... Kay...
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
I can't let him down.
What was it, so I'll know.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
I asked about Fredo?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
They are everywhere!
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
He's going to try Panama...
No strings.
Thanks...friend.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
There are still things I have to do.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Not good.
No.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
I do not.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
I thought we would meet alone.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
We got friends in the commission.
How much more a month?
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Your wife?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Your family ate dripping?
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
How long were you...?
Cut it out!
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Not at all.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
All right.
Fuck off!
Goodbye, Hanna.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Right.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
What's that?
Yeah?
C'mon, man ...
Dignity...
Remember who my brother is?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Damn crooks is everywhere --
You, too
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
"Shadow games?"
Dad'd be proud --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Toby...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
What are you doing here?
Hey -
Now... I'm in ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
Yeah ... You -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
She soars -
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
What?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Get inside!
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Never.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
We'll pick it up.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
She went to Medical school in California.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
It's a way outta here.
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
And what do you see?
What is it?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
That you meet with me twice a week--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Hey, how you doin'?
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
I appreciate that.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Not at all.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Me too.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What do you want to do?
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
What places?
What?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
You're getting defensive, Will.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Oh.
Crayons?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Why thank you.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Well, are you going out again?
Haven't called her.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
My wife's dead.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
You're not going to fail me are you?
It's not your fault.
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
How was that?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
Well...
We'll do that.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
No.
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Yeah, I'm sure.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Naw. They paroled me.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Deputy sheriffs.
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Excuse me for asking.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
What you figger to do?
I don't know.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
But we can still do it, honey.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You been acrost?
This here's a strike.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No.
When?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
He was a good man.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I wisht it was day.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You do not.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Don't say that.
I'm a professional killer.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Yep.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Okay... Hold on...
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Get the fuck outta here.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Will you come with me?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Mmm.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Is that right?
I guess.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
No...
I'm not happy.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
I spoke to your father the other day.
You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
I have to get my head back into my work.
See you in ten years.
How are you? How's business?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
You too.
Poor thing.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Annie!
No, you didn't.
What?
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What?
That's not true!
You already did.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Tom's gone.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Hi.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
The funeral's on Friday.
How's my pregnant chick!
Why did you go?
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Everything all right.
About what?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
I don't understa-
Tubab means white man.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
She calls him Tommy...
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Promise.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
That must have been pretty special.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
No!
I thought your mom's coming up?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
I want to see Pilgrim.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
I'm gonna hit you!
Difficulty rating?
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Yeah?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
And unpack.
Give it up! Just give it up.
How did you know that?
It nibbles. You see this?
Fucked if I care, man.
I'll give it a shot.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Uhhhmm...
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
So?
Just one moment.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So?
You don't owe me anything.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
I don't know!
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
We should call the fire department.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Outside.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
What?
Oh Rachel!
I can't.
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Dear God.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Don't touch him Jamie!
You blame everything on kids.
That's not true. Here I am.
We just talked.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
I've already lost it.
Bye.
Lies.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Totally.
Hi, Tommy.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
I've given them his profile.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Come in, come in.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
A lot of works.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, is that what it is?
Okay.
What?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
We're actresses.
I cry at the opera.
Yes.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
And it ruins everything else.
Hi.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
I don't know exactly.
Hi.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh, God.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yeah.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I almost didn't.
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
Is something wrong?
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
You're not lost.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
Oh, Frederick!
I'm sorry.
Who is it?
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, now-- 
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Uh-oh.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
So what's new?
Oh, what do they know?
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Yeah, that's clerical.
My--uh...
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I was so bored!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, I am.  I am.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Right.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
It's all right.
Just a few minutes ago.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Take our literature...
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
...how are things at the Hospital?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
...they did it for a lark.
That's right.
What's new onna street?
...would you excuse me...?
Why did he come back?
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Exactly.
Try Barney Clark.
...here's to child abuse!
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Shut up, Starling...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
No. 
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
You nervous...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Yes.... yes...
Sir, with all due respect....
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
...not to turn around.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Fine, thank you, but
...what do you expect me to...
Because...?
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
What are you gonna do about it?
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
You guys have been so colossal...
You're all making me blush...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Wendy, I'll come back later.                                ] ] WENDY                                              ] Why does every ten year old know                            ] what they want to be when they grow                         ] up, but then as you actually grow                           ] up, you forget every--The girls are                         ] big on "Veterinarian" this year--                           ] I think it could be the "ballerina"                         ] of this century.                                            ]
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't worry, you...
Not now, Wendy.
Shut the fuck--!
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
It's not my style, okay?
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
What are you doing here?!
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Jealous much?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Incredible similarity.
You must have had fun.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Goddamn Geek!
I think so, man.
I guess.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Is it hurting, dear?
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Come on, sit up.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
Open this door!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Mummy!
Saint Mario!
It's so beautiful!
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Just a couple more . . .
Yes . . .
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
I did more then that.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Well?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
I understand... I won't-
Just get better okay?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Have we met?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
No please make yourself at home.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Two.
Can you follow them?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
What things do you think you've done?
Really?
It's getting hot in here.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Right.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Unprofessional.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
She's talking to him now.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
You must value your independence.
A man scared me.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Holly -- that's not so.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
Thanks, Mom.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
Did you hear what he said?
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
I'm having the floor fixed,
I think it's time I came home now.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Isn't it?
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
No.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
It's a double.
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
Yes.
For what?
She'll soon be of age.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
The past?
I'm leaving in the morning.
I cannot explain.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
Is it?
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Conner?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
Why did you wait?
I can take care of myself.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
I think he's dead!
Get to work.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
Bullshit!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
It's about Mars --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
They're fine.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Okay.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
I'm getting a doctor!
We're trapped in a house.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
We don't have time!
I don't know.
You have his address?
Give me an ETA.
You'd better be kidding.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Holster your guns!
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
He didn't say.
Go.
She didn't answer.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
What's my name?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I thought they locked you in your room.
No!  They're right here --
Smith will know.
We, who is we?
A delegation.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Of course.
Let me explain.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
I can't, I don't have the men.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The police are very busy.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Very soon.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
For supplies, you drive.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Why sir?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
The commander is not here.
Show me your ID
What cards?
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Your brother's here?
We must do something.
You could have asked for a favor.
Murdered! By whom?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
It was substantial.
Please, please try one more time.
No.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Many times.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Thank you, Roger.
Where?
On the street.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
So what stopped her?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Is she alright?
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
I'm better than that.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
Let's try down here...
It's succeeding!
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
No, no, it's just --
What?
I am.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Fascinated.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
Oh, dear.
Melissa...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
It might have been her mother.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Yes.  It was.
No!
How's your arm?
She's down...how do you mean honey?
What about all my other stuff?
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
She's here.
My God, I heard something!
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Oh come on...
Were you fooling with the power?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
We're not going.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Your apartment.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Not quite.
What do you want?
Really?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Why not just go now?
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
Ooh-kay...
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
A little petting is not the issue!
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Tell me about it...
Snappy.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm plenty happy!
A sawbuck!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Mind if I join you?
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Please! Norville!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
You mean you know about this?
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I filed it yesterday.
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Huh?! But, buddy --
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah?
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Get your feet off that desk.
But, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
He don't look wise.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Of course, Wes.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Um, yes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
It's a starting place.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
We're not going anywhere.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Right. Gotcha.
Huh?
C'mon.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Oh Wendy.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Of course.
Educated guess.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
But not too ashamed.
That I will indeed.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
I gotta get to English class.
Flame on, asshole.
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
No!
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Good.  He's up next.
I don't remember.
He would have liked that.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Long as it's fun.
What was?
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Perhaps...
She is.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
He'll never let us go.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
And no one knows but us...
Never.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Give it to me!!!
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You have fed. You were made for this...
It can't be...
Fascination...
I don't know any hell -
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
I tried...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
He did it to make you stay with him!
But it has. There is no more to tell.
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
And you know what you ask for?
Yes!
The guy looks dead.
What are you doing in my closet?
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Then, don't.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Fine. Show me the body.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
It's...him.
I wasn't dreaming.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Yes!
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
So why are you still here?
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
I don't know now without my father.
She has never mentioned her family.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
They shall not hurt you
She is dead — at peace.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Theodosia.
Her family name?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
But the war, the army —— they need you.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Well, tell, him.
It is for that he hates me.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Oh, no.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Who is it?
George Bailey.
What's that book you've got there?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Hiya, George!
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Today, over at the house.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
No charge.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Well then, how do you know?
Aw, get going!
Well, no younger than I was.
Have a good time, son.
Say, where's Mother?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
What's that?
Hello, Violet.
I know, but . . .
All of it?
The whole town's gone crazy.
Hello?
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Neither am I.
Okay –– what can we lose?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Come on, tell me.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
About what?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Darling, you're wonderful.
My baby.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Going up to see Zuzu.
I've eaten.
With butter, if they got any....
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
In here.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
I kind of had plans....
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
What shark?
Do you?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Home it is.
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Do you?
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
I'll give notice.
Mike's out there.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
What?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
What for?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Yeah?  Then what?
That's what he said.
Dad!  Dad!
Great.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I will, I will.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Tina Wilcox.
I know.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Next week.
And second?
Mmmmmm.
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I'm not sure I can.
No.
Eat Cheerios.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
You're going sailing.
No.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
No.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I know I can capture it.
What's that?
... Me, too.
What's up?
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
What do you mean, we don't?
I don't understand.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
You don't have to prove anything.
I'm  fine.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Afraid I can't do that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Not at all.
Why are you?
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
I should have never listened to Calvin.
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
He's missing.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
It's okay, Sean.
SEAN!
What're you doing later?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
That's impossible.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
That's Dad...
Something wrong?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Nowhere....
I don't know...You...I don't know.
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
It's beginning....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
We'll be there....
You make sure they come?
You check it....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
You can stay in my room.
Thank you....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
Trying to write our report....
I'm fine....
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sure you can....
It's wonderful....
A big one....
I'm sorry...I....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
She said it was coming....
Get her started....
We'll be done pretty soon....
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
I stuck them on, man....
They won't fight with me....
They put bombs on dolphins....
When I got the grant.....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
As long as he's been here....
What about Carla's gig?
She's not going to like it....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
Screw you, Jake....
I've got to get to her....
I'm training to....
I'll take care of it.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean, Ross?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Pay me, and I shut up.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
I'm asking it.
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Bits.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
You know? How do you know?
Then why didn't he kill me?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Don't mix very well with beer.
Freddy's new obsession ..
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Whass going on here?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
Oh honey.  It's spun.
It's over --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Wait.  What do you mean?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Do you have something to drink?
Sure.
Yeah, I did.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Easy, easy --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Will you marry me?
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Well, this was another way to go.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Why not --
I think so.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Let's go the zoo.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Funny.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
You hate to swim.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
I filmed this the morning they left.
No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
Where is it?
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
You think they could talk to each other?
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Yeah.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Minimal.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
I don't believe you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Where does it say that?
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You've broken its leg!
Possible.
You're going too?
It has a broken leg!
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
John Hammond.
Think fast, Sarah.
I believe in him.
Oh, no!
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Shhhhh!
Six weeks?
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
We were right!
Dilophosaurus.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
What's that?
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Hola, bienvenido
He sends his apologies.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
Dilophosaurus.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Tim.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
No.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Yeah, they hate me.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
You're sure?!
There's gotta be something - -
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
I'll stay awake.
All night?
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Thanks, Dad.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Sure.
They don't bother me.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
I think we're lost.
I really think we should go back...
Fuck you.
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Not yet.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Yes -- that's us.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
I'll commit that to memory.
You're just doing your job.
Sit down, Kafka.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
Have you looked?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
They're not obliged to tell.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Orlac is an account?
It's not too bad working here.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Mm.
No, I'm look --
-- Tuscarora --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
OK.
What do you think?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Well -- she's dead.
Is there anything more I could --
Well --
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Don't worry.
Why?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
We did this before.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
You're going back?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
You wanted to, or you are?
You could at least look at me!
Can you use these?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Well as a matter of --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Not unusual.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Not particularly.
Detroit.
Playing.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
No!
You're no bargain either, pal.
Yep.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
No.
I...I don't know...
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
I consider it less my failure than his.
What about Billy?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Beautiful.
Kramer...
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
No, but--
Mr. Kramer, there's--
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
How many onions does it say to use?
No.  I don't think so.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Sure.
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
You and Charley?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
Can I do anything I want?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
And we will begin with tearing it down.
How many?
Where is Alsace?
Look here!
America, we shall see.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Ahh.
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
I see that.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I need to see his habitat.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Yup.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Just those two.
<u>Hector</u>.
What's going on?
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Are you sure?
Nothing's real.
Oh, bullshit.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
I <u>told</u> you.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
That's probably good.
What are you talking about?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Likewise.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Did he say anything?
I can look at dead things.
You talk to the married couple?
<u>We</u>?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
It's just that--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
I just let go of it.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Look.
That it's about to go wrong.
<u>Kelly</u>--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Yes sir.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Why?
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
Point taken.
You seem pretty sure of that.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Sometimes you do.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
May I see your credentials?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Dr. Lecter -
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Let us go, miss.
Your "father"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
What?!
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
My letter...
"Some"?
Yes. Yes, I will.
No.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Will you men help us stop the French?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Atten-hut!
Fire!
Yes.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
And this?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
My colors?
Be my guest.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Was there such a thing?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Stay calm!
What?...
What has?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Still...you did the right thing.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
The escape bubbles?
Can't we fix it?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
...and a Russian grandmother...
Itches like hell.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
No fuckin' lie...
I ought to smack your face!
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
Why, what's up?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
I'll only be a minute.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
How the fuck should I know?
They're not going to jail.
The--the officers.
Because it's a job?
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're testing me?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
You little pissant--
That's in Maverick County.
Best part of the job.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
If it's too late--
They fought against the Indians?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
You wouldn't?
Right.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
We been through this before--
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Protection?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He still living?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
I got an idea what happened.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
I was too busy.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
That's me.
You ever play one of these?
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
No. Is he sick?
For a while.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Enough with the clothes--
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
So I've heard--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Pilar--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I'm going over to the other side.
Yeah.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
What's up?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Otis what?
They go together.
I love weird.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
He won't.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I can be very persuasive.
That's my business. Harry.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I told you --
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Nothing?
Maybe I just bought it.
Are you a gambling man?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
I tried to pay you off.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
The Puritan?
Was he taking a lot of risks?
For what?
Well... nobody.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
And you're not?
And you believed him?
No.
I can't... I can't go any further...
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
No.
Binding you.
Liar!
Ok.
How long have you been married?
Not really. How long are you here for?
No, its easy.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
But, I'm mean.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Four.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yes, no.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Yes?
I don't know.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Great.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Bye.
What happened?
I can't believe Will killed him.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I found the pentacle.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
You have to tell me who did it.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Miette, come here and relax.
Kelson, hold on a second...
Well I know he's come here before.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
What?
What?
What do you mean?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What are these?
Sure.
What did he say to you in French?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
What happened?
How is he?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
It mattered, Mom.
He's fine.
Okay.
Thanks.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
What?
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
I found you someone.
No.
He's in college?
I know.  But chances are...
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
So how's the job going?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
I was just playing ball.
Uh huh.
He works at a bank.
I don't know.  A lot.
Five seconds.
Your hot-ass temper.
God, here we go.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
You having fun?
None of your business.
Whatever, big head.
Fine, Quincy.
Quit.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
Nobody.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You're what?
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
No.
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Why do you keep asking me that?
From basketball.
What?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Keep your voice down.
Uh, your earring?
I've been hearing you.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I ain't a damn liar.
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
You want me to fuck off?
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I don't know.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Oh, she's fine.
It's a helluva disease.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Honey.
I'm sorry.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
No.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Please, yes.
Yeah.
Why not?
...yeah...
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
ok.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
That was so great what you just said.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Sure, why?
How much time do we have?
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Is it real love?
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
You don't need braces.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
I've seen it before.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
So boring, so useless --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Around here.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Where does that name come from?
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
What does it look like?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Been drinkin' today?
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Did your wife find out?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I'm drinking.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
I don't.
...I don't know...
I'm her father.
It's alright.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Shut the fuck up.
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Why did you do this?
Go to bed.
..sorry...
It's not right.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
This happens....this is something that happens.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is your brother!
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
More wine!!
But -- but --
You're a fool!
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I heard your playing.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Get out of my way.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Get out of my way.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
I... we are humble people...
My dear, I've already done it.
Oh Louis, Louis...
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
Fine -
Yeah...
She stole my car!!
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Found what?
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
1490...Breckinridge...
How about Marvosa and the others?
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Hop in.
Screw him!
Not with this...
Did you have sex with her?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Twenty minutes max.
When do they go to press?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Library of Congress.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
See? You do know something about him.
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
This is our boy...!
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
No. Reba...?
It's me.
Francis...?
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Oh, God.
Do you see?
No.
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
No.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Where did you get it?!
Linda doesn't come in nights.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Cut the general crap.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I have to see somebody.
I love you...
Do you remember what you said?
Will...
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
You got a deal...
Yeah...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
...after a while.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
No.
Yes. I'd considered it.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
You got it.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
There'll be other shots.
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
I don't wanna talk about it!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No thanks.
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
What?!?
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Are you sure?
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
They're gonna lynch him!
What's your name?
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
The orders were for your protection.
Oh, God.
I don't know... My computer...
Hear what?
An accident?!
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
What happened to them?
Just get me outta here.
He's beginning to believe.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
Please.  Come.  Sit.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
More important than what is when?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Your training.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Who?
What?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Who is?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
Yes.
... right as rain.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Because...
I believe I can bring him back.
Yeah?
Zion?
They're hacking his mind.
Cypher, I thought --
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
You got sparklers?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Why?
She don't look Jewish.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther!  Same thing...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Did you see them run!
I understand.
Don't be smart.
No you're not...
Mind your own business.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
You said it.
I know.
Stripper?
Yes, you did.
Oh...around...why?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
What do they expect you to say?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Maybe, who knows.
Did you?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
You ate?
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
He's coming.
He's cute.
Who's Annie?
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
I wasn't going to say --
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Is there any more to it?
Sit down, Drew.
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Yeah.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Nuthin'.
I am.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
I didn't know that.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
No.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I don't have any.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I mean I appreciate that.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
More than you love peanut butter?
For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
And you can't tell me who you are.
It's a saying.
Thank you for loving me.
Thank you.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Sounds fair enough.
I guess so.
Of course.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
You tell me, Bill.
Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
So that's what love is?
Get him in here.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
-- An IRS man.
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yeah, I give a shit.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Sure.
Yes, I believe I do.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
What were you going to say?
Aw, you're tough.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.
You don't know anything about Joe --
Where's he going?
I'm sorry.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Me?  Internal medicine.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Why?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
Whatever gets you off.
Burt.
Condition?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Quiet!
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
What are you gonna do?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
No!
How?
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Who's your boyfriend?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Teddy!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Who?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
We know these people...!
Oh, yeah...
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Where's the new drop point...?
What do you think?
It's a rip and a hit.
I got the item.
Two main players plus three.
My end?
Make it 40%.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Show me...?
Where's that?
The Keys?
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
What do you mean?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
I do.  We don't do business with him...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Nothing.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
You're giving away your money, fool...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
Goodbye.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
You sure?
What flowers?
"Salutations from the south..."
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Alonzo...
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Oh hell, forget it.
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
You like it? Take a look.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
And what?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You want me to leave?
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Twenty months?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
For the money... )
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Oh Jesus! 
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
He wasn't even in the car?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Where is it?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Oh we... we...
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
You can't take anything seriously.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
That's a great philosophy.
Who?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
And a right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
No, you talkin' at me.
Oh, Jesus!!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
What do you-?
No...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Don't get kinky here...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Right.
No.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
It worked before...
Talk to me.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
It's right this way.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
--my number one fan.
What are they...?
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
Then the roads are open...
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Misery?
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
Done?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
Perfect.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
So you've indicated. Do it.
C'mere, I'll show you.
Annie, what's the matter?
I want my pills NOW!
--not fair?
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
I can't write this anymore.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
To Misery.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Be my guest.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
You think he might be missing?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
So do I...
Buster.
Newspapers?
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Where is it?
Hugh, I'm impressed..
How I usually find you, Nyah.
How do you that.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
I suppose I did.
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
It's that time.  Go.
Ninety-three point four million.
Right.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
At least you walked.
You didn't do that badly.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
They've got a book for everything.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Can you think of a better one?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
What did you think of him?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Very.
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
Yes, I gathered as much.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
I told her to get outta there.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
All ten million.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Talking's good, walking's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You don't think we're going to make it.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Youíre in Prague?
Yeah.  I follow you.
Profitable.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Like Job?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Just don't chew it.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Whatís going to make him do that?
I don't know.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
You look tired.
It's temporary.
And what did they say?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Maybe I should come back another time.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Instantaneous.
Seven years ago.
Why you talking to me?
I was dead, too.
I've got you.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It makes you look like an angel.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
You don't get along with anybody!
I'm in love with you!
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Kinda gaudy.
You're making me feel guilty again.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Will you marry me?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Where you been?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What! How do you know?
Everything's different.
No. But I have a hangover.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Okay, I'll tell her.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Are you sure?
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
Is who down there?
I knew she had it.
Burn them.
Through ... We found them.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
What?
I am your king!
I'll have your leg.
You'll what ... ?
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Behind the rabbit?
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Shut up!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
And therefore?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is your name?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Ninepence.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Yes?
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Oh ... hello ...
We'll cover your escape!
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Not down south you don't.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
I can't move to tidy.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mr Brown, sir --
Good man.  And is she all right?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
Whom you address.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
No.
Do you hunt?
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
Surely --
Aye.
You are well?
I am.
Archie.
Those, over there, there.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Yes, ma'am.
I do not accept.
Yes.  Yes it was.
I came as quickly as I could.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Yes.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Excellent!
How ill is he?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Your Majesty --
From whom?
Why is he not here?
Then why are you not with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Hey, kid.
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
What?
It's already out.
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Dante's Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I know.  It sucks.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Hold my keys, then.
That way.
Is that your question?
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
I understand.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Good luck, honey!
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Before what?
Can you tell me what happened?
Diane?
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"So... surprise"...
Do you know them?!
No... but...
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
This Denny's.
Go ahead.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
Pick with expediency !
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
No one has a gun to your head.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
McCay knows ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Not listening !
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
I wanted to let his family know....
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Yes.
And that's different than this because...... ?
Because of my charming personality ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Son, let's watch the tape.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
What do you mean sir ?
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
I'm listening.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thank you.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Zach from work ?
I'm fine.
We made it !
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
No.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh, just put it over there.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I don't even know your name.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Me, I'll know!
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
I figured you did.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Of course.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Special effects?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
I never met my mother.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I won't.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
No THANKS!
I'd never do that.
And I thought I was weird.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Uh oh...
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Not exactly.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Something wrong?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I'm impressed.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Yeah.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Good.
Goodnight Shelly.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Perfect.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
The money?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Can I go too?
Yes.
He's okay isn't he?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
Get away from me!
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Have you ever tried any?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Oh great!!
Goodnight.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Come on, it's fun.
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
So?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
I dunno..
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
He's still in love with you.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
You've been working on this, huh?
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
I can't even say it.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
He said that, too.
Hello.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Well, somet...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
She's too genuine.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Boy, those were the days.
No.  I've got you.
Except for that.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
A bad combination.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
DON'T SPEAK!
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Well, it better not happen again.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
I know that, Star.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
I see.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
All those people...
You're so good.
What's wrong with her.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Oh, sure.
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
I said 'no!'
Your job, huh.
Who the hell is he?
What!
Whose?
When is it?
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
National?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
What is a turkey shoot.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
You must really like him.
No.
No.
Nash.
Sixty-three.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
The car broke down.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
And before?
Do you ever do any writing?
Tom. You remember?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Wow!
Well...
That's what you said before.
I know. Goodbye.
Oh.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
He's pretty well known down here.
What!
Where are you going?
Oh?
I mean...
Depends on what I'm studying.
Why?
Who?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
I see.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
Anything.
Yes, sir.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
We are.  Your camera.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Unfortunately, yes.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Thanks.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Why?
How so?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
By all means.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Lose 'em.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Hell, you got steady work.
Used to be. On the railroad.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Where's Wilma?
Okay.
Well, he worked around.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Yes, aren't you?
That's right.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
You got a problem all right.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
No.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
You still didn't answer my question.
I don't want to hurt you.
Huh?
Well, I haven't come around.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
Like what?
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
Okay.
All right, son.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Better now.  Where 'you at?
You hate Raoul?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
It hasn't yet.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Linked?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Right...
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
How much time you got left?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I thought you already left.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
What?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Give me five minutes.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
No we don't...
Like what?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Why do they listen to Guy?
Oh I know.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
College?
Yeah, I know.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
By Guy?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
OUT!
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
My sword.
You said that already.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Little known fact.
Yes, desperately.
No. Josie, this is real.
Thanks. And what are -
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Why do you do that?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Do you think you'll find her?
Thanks. So do you.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Why?
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Everybody knows about--
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
For this.
Yes.
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
It's getting there.
Who's Lisa?
Oh, come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He'll die with me!
Naw. Just killing time.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
What are you doing here?
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
It's happening again.
That's okay, I wanted to.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
I don't know.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
yeah, I had a bad night.
I killed him!  I killed him!
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I can't!
You okay?
No.  I'm okay.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I'm serious.
Hi Mom.
How's your hand?
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
Sure.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Never been here before?
Sounds like a rough time.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Anything?
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Your dreams?
What?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Where...here?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Okay.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
I thought you were leaving.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
She left me.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Jesus.
You do?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
What's your name?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
Right. 
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
Any bit in particular?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Fabulous.
Yes.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
Why?
Tell us about it...
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Thank you, ma'am...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
So do I!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Shhh...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Are they all crazies?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
A pecking party?
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
With your own two hands?
You heard me the first time!
Sure, Mack...
Why not?
Who told you that?
Bye-bye.
I'm hungry.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
We'll let you know.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay!
All right!
How much ya wanna bet?
Yeah, what's up?
'Kay...
Come an' see.
No...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Yes, ma'am...
I'm sure you will.
Thank you, ma'am,
Now you talkin'.
Is everything all right?
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Is he one of the loonies?
Is he in an asylum?
Si.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
No...
Ha un numero di telefono?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
But Faith--
Amazing.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That was before I found out what it was.
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Yeah.
No.  Course not.
Beautiful place...
Well, not exactly...
And more...
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Oh.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
Does Dwayne know about this?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
What?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Oh.  Right.
What is it?
What's that supposed to mean?...
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Sure you did.
Is he looking at us?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
A little bad luck?
...and a fortune teller.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
And Larry?...
A porco?
Giovanni.
That's exactly what you are.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She didn't give me a chance.
That's really romantic.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
I wish I knew.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mm—hmm.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Don't say that!
I could have been better!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
See! You don't understand!
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
None of your business.
I better see you get there.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
The moment I saw you.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
Oh she's a beauty.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I don't know.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Told him what?
You... .
Get away from me.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Farm...
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Let me by.
About Edie?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Good luck.
Your gun.
You go to hell.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Down to the wire?
What about it?
Take it easy.
I'm just resting my feet.
Sure... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Be sure they got enough water.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
I'll see you on the roof.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
My favorite little cousin.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Where?
In there.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
Be careful!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
When!?
Ahh, there is yet time.
I understand, Master
There are others.
Then cancel my order.
You may take her now.
You know better than that.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Tell me, how do you do that?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
She's coming with us.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You at least bring the gun?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
I saw Karen Sisco.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
In the trunk, yeah?
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
You don't, huh?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Nervous?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
We still talk, though.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Shit...
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
How do we do that?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
It smelled.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I don't think we should get into that.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
The backseat.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I hear six.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Just a minute.
What did you call it?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
Huh.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
No.  Course not.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
That's how you score now?
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Yes Sir.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Hale-what?
Land of the free...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Bombers.
I know.
Sorry to trouble you.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Fook ya dooble!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
He does?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
Oh yeah?
Great, isn't it?
Who?
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Why?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Just take a look at it. 
I'm trying.
I'll just set it right here.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Touchy, touchy!
What, why?
What are you shooting for?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Thank God for that.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Yes.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
I'm excused.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
What do you mean?
I don't feel very festive.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
What are you talking about?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
How'd you know that?
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
It sucked.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
There's a better place...
Dies?
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Andy?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Drew!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
No sweat, buddy.
A carrot?!
We're waiting...
Funny.
Uh, yeah.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Nine.
We?
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Rayisha.
No. They didn't fire her.
It's me, you dork.
Not bad.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Thank you.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
... we've got a committee meeting.
My lettuce is wilting.
Night, honey.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
... It's time to get this society back on track!
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
But I just wanted to say --
<u>Listen</u>.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Not sure. Ten?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Rain.
Which half?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Just the same, I want one.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
No, they won't -
You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
None at all.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
He's trying to form words.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
I'm prepared to die.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Shaddup bitch.
Youse so fucked up man.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
'Lias come naturally.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
Fuck you Elias.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
He dugged his own grave.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Immigration Officer?
What did you say his name was?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
I don't.
They know you here--know your name.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
Killaine...
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
No.  I paid him off.
Mine?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
A graduation present.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
Morning. Any calls?
I'm still asking. What do you want?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
A thousand.
Sometimes.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Quite sure you had no motive?
A couple of hours.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
No idea.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Thank you.
Let me know when you've identified him
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
You get it's brother.
Open it and count it.
I've met her.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Warm water, no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Now, you're being beastly.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
She might.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
What does it look like?
I say YES!
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
I'm not sure I can face it.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And I didn't like that man.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
I called you a taxi.
Well, you should.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
To the Fleet.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Okay, I will.
Have you come to talk about me?
What about the Cromwells?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
No.
You'd look naked without one.
Promise?
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Not yet.
A flaw I'm working on.
I say when it's over!
I take the skin off chicken.
Not so far.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Okay, Dad.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Shrimp and fries.
I need you to teach me.
Catch of the day.
Meaning you were expendable.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Well somebody sent them.
Anytime.
He knows our defenses.
He's not really my uncle.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
What?
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
What?
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Oooh, thank god.
Yes...
No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
What are assets?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Where'd you learn to do this?
Of course.  How much?
This isn't a date.
Television?
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
Shall we mingle?
Vivian, what the --
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
You won't.
I've never treated you like a whore.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Afternoon.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Yes...
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I bet.  That was our rent!
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Why'd he want you?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I... Edward...
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Will I like it?
Steak spoon! 
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
I don't think it would fit you.
It's very expensive.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Of course.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
But how can you be sure?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Who's Guilder?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Has it been fifteen minutes?
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Where did you get that?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
I swear it will be done.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Stop saying that!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He's already dead.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Thank you.
Again. Thank you.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You are ready, then?
Then why are you smiling?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
What are you saying?
"To my honey I'll croon,
Oooooooops!
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Do the books!  Do the books!
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Mr. Bialystock ...
But that's cheating!
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Right.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
To failure!
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Really, I never dreamed ...
We swear it!
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Groovy!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Money.
I don't believe it.  Do you?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Like what?
I don't know.
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Where... can I stay?
Where could he have gone?
Who's he?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Neither will I.
Alive.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
How can you even think a thing like that!
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Norman Bates.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
You go out... with friends?
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
That's it. 
Good night.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
I don't know what you've been saying.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Mother, please...
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
You--a friend to me?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Why didn't you notify the police?
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
You lie!
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd call it stupid at any time.
I'd love to, at any time.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
I'd love to.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Nope, I'm through!
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
No kiddin'.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
How?
Like now?
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Nobody.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
But I'm curious, Rose.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Well, nothin'.
But Rose...
Am I hurting you?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
I don't want to know...
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I don't know.
Well, it's not very plain.
She's watching the car again?
They're discussing it.
He kissed her.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
What?
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Quarter of twelve.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Honey, please...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Oh, yeah?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
I don't mind.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Again.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Lay off once, would you?
We should slow down.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
You don't smoke.
Birth control's important.
It doesn't say that.
No, but it should.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
Nope.
There probably is.
Where have you been?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Murderer?  Really?
Let me see that...  Not bad.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I know it is, even if you don't.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
Beholden to none.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
Yoda will always be with you.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The same as always.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Oh, no.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Oh. Well, yes.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Oh well.  How about you.  
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
Janet.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh, lucky him.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
It's not that --
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Don't want weak legs.
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
...I can't beat him.
That so.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Only a pig would say that!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
...Stop jivin'!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Very high an' very fast.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
...Ten minutes.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Stuff it, man!
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...Tomato?
Ya puttin' me on?
Yeah.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Ya got heart.
I never had good footwork.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Looks, huh?
Don't get mental, man.
...Sure.
Ice skate.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
It don't matter.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Apollo's a great fighter.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
R.K. Maroon.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
No...
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Why didn't you tell me?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
I don't work in Toontown.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Divorce?  Never!
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
My brother.  Get inside.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Forget it.
Two bits.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Of love?
At thy good heart's oppression.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
You kiss by the book.
Ahhh!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Pink for flower.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
I don't know.
And then...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
You were a soldier, were you?
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
Nobody's saying they don't.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Of course.
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
It's done.
So what do we do?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I do, I do...
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
It's been known to happen.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
No thanks.
Something like that...
I asked if we could give him anything else.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Because that's what I would have done...
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Do you have a good answer?
And now...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
The Russian would be easier.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I don't know what you're -
Don't lie to me!!!!
Seven thousand...
Why?
We'll figure something out.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
There it is...now what about the others?
Do you have everything?
That's right.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
I might have to look into that...
Heard you had quite a night.
I know.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
You deserve it is the occasion.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
A week ago, at most.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Dwayne.
Did you say After Midnight?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Have I seen her?
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
Yeah whaddya want?.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
So I want the money and I want it now.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
And what happened?
So someone did get away.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
I said get on your feet!
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
How you doin'?
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What is it?
Take it!
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
She saved our lives.
It doesn't matter.
I think we should stop talking.
Fine by me.
Mind your own business.
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
End of the line.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I need your help.
Any leads?
Are you okay, Lee?
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
A little.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yeah, it's good.
No, fish is a PM food.
It's him.
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
No...what?
They put you in charge?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Han?
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm not running.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
Got any last minute advice?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Are you a reporter?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Yes.
A pre-wedding luau?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Excuse me?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Yup!
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Okay.
Nope.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
So you're angry.  Big deal.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I love you.
Happy New Year.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Can too.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Is this crazy?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Howard.
Howard.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Yes, I did.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
What's she talking about?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
Fair enough.
No.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
Do you want a fruit plate?
It's a spice rack.
What?!
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.
Will she scratch up your back?
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
I know.
Bye bye blackbird.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
No.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
Well...
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You want 'em all arrested?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
So much the better.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
I did forget. Luís told me.
He'll have it good. Some day.
Over my dead body.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
No.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
It's downright classy is what it is.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
Colette ...
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
I can't leave.
And you admire that?
What do you want from me, Colette?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Please open the door, Danny.
You always been this stubborn?
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
How?
Twelve
Finland is a country.
Sure.
Sure, Jimmy.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
No last name?
Tell me what?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Answer the fucking question!
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
To who?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Really?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Resistance?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Yep.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Say what, Cap'n?
That only leaves three.
I changed my mind.
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Nope.
How about I go right, sir?
Let's just find someplace.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
Yes, sir.
What are we going to do?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
But we accomplish the mission.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Get back to your positions!
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Alright, come with me.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Frogs?
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
He's a mess!
But you never had a first date.
I'm gonna call her.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I'll put this past my boss
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Dad.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
I'm so ashamed dad.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You know what?
I think you should wear that.
Mmmm.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't think so.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
No, we don't have to say it.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
The truck?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How do you pay for one of those?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
So what's up?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Alright!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Yeah, alright.
I'm talking to a clerk.
It's good business.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Yeah, I can.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
She's good.
Things are great, things are great.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
I'm inquisitive.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
No, it's not.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
No. This is a set up.
You’re not going to get away with this.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I got it..
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
So we found a compromise.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Billy had alibis too.
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Don't worry...
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
Watch your back.
Too bad.
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
But she's standing right next to you.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Good bye Ben.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Hmm.
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Huh, fine.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
What?  What movie?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where the fuck did she go?
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You lost your mom...
What?
Uh-huh.
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Don't hang up on me.
No-bored.
Or else what?
Sure...
Why are you doing this?
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
No, not yet.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Can I bring Kenny?
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
At the airport.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Yeah.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
The phone's dead.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
That's the original part.
...so call if you need me.
Don't shoot. It's me.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Yeah.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
What happened?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
It's alright. I'll get it.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
And you believe it?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
TATUM!
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
You know.
I heard.
It's always been like this.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
You'll see.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
Totally unrelated victims.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Who pays the rent on time.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Yes we do.  Here...
And so what?
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
What?  Assessing fines?
I don't.  Neither do you.
You can't go in there.
You do your job...
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
There's no time to discuss it!
What are you talking about?  What happened?
What?
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
Really?
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
I don't know.
How should I know?
Yes sir...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Just keep goin'...
Sir?
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
What?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Why didn't he make his move back there?
No...not yet...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Come on, say it.  You know...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
Right you are, governor!
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Lady?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Ned is wrong for it.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Most interesting.
So now you are free to love
There's never any
Of course not!
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
To my weekly confession.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Will Shakespeare!
I am.
Oh--no, no!
That's my line!
You cannot marry Wessex!
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
Orsino…good name
My lord.
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
But what of Lord Wessex?
A man, my lord?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Come on, David.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
But there's no --
No. Why should it?
Take another look at these two.
Yes.
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
-- instead of what he is --
The man we know and love.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
You want me to kick it open?
What? What's wrong?
Who was it?
Don't you?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't you ever stop?
Downstairs.
Can we come in?
What?
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
Exactly what I was --
Eh --
That one, last week.
I see.
I'm a doctor.
What?
I suppose so.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to talk about it...
Well she...
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Nobody can hear it.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Then what do you think?
How is she?
Well, yeah... you know.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
I don't know. Probably not.
No, thanks.
Great.
Did Lester know about him?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
What?
I don't want to... I swear...
What are you talking about?
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You were great.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
No --
What for?
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Wanda...
What with?
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- Otis?
Okay... thanks...
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
Now, George --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Yeah.
-- Sure.
What!
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Great... can we talk later?
When can I talk to you?
About what?
Your advice!
When is that, George?
... Okay...
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Bullshit.
Where did this come from?
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
What difference does it make?
No.
Thank you.
When?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
All night.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I said sit down!
What, do you think I planned it?
I'll call you back.
A daytime soap opera.
Then you were talking to him.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll call you.
See you later.
I know, I'm sorry.
-- No. No really.
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Is he an enemy?
He's a hairdresser.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You're going.
No... how long did you say?
Three weeks.
No, Dad.
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Is there something bad here?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
All right, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Pleasure to meet you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
No, nothing at all.
Good.
How do you like it?
You can't remember.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Jack, stay away from me!
Go away.
Wendy...
Wendy...
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
I'm intrigued.
Thank you, Susie.
Don't call me dear boy.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Yeah... sure.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
No.
I saw what I saw.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think they hear you!
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Oh my! 
HE'S SO FINE.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
You betcha.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Because we're
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
It's true -- I know her.
Were you wicked?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
You know that song?
Whatever.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Now you.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Honey.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
It's true!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
What? 
Are you talking about me?
Check your driver's license.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Deal.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
No problem.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Mary Clarence!
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Then-you run.
No nothing.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Really.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It didn't happen.
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Where is she?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
He's decent.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
You must have missed your mark.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
Excuse me?
What is that?
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
May we look at them now?
Well... that might be... helpful.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
No, I couldn't...
Should we go back?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Why this tree?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Lady Van Tassel.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I doubt that's the end.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
It would be interesting to find out.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What did he say, Katrina?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What would you have me believe?
I... I can't do this.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
She is guilty.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He does make some funny noises.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
Yeah.
You told me to come by.
All right then.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Yeah.
Oh, jackin' off?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Mama?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
Yes, I guess you are.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
No ma'am.
Yeah.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Oh. How about before that?
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I'd love to.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuck you, kid.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
You usually get two.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
I mean, it's a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Like what?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
And how much are these?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
Jesus.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It was just a thought.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Baby? And what baby is that?
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
I mean breakfast.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
In Manhattan?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
What time is it?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
And started to run.
Well?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
None.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
You done your math right.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
You're implying th...
I said.  No further questions.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Carl Heine came.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Maybe.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Obviously.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Bye.
Wanna see my driver's license?

It's private.  Go away.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
You've flipped your wig!
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
How can we?  We're broke.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
I'm engaged.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
What engagement present?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Get me Room 414.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I'm a very sick girl.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Most of the time I slap it.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Flower girl.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
I forgive you.
My car?  Why, you -
You got to be under twenty-five -
Yes, we're the new girls.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Brains aren't everything.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
I want mine to wear glasses.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Not very likely.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Guess!
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Three?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Complete washout.
I don't want to bore you.
Thanks just the same.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
I knew you would.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Why?
Refresh my memory.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Yeah, kind of.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Crikey.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
What?!
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Yeah.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I’m so sorry.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Oh, well, then. It probably won’t work out.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
That's right--
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
But where is my daddy!?
Nothin'...
No, Miss Johnson...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
NO! N-O, NO!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Here, put my jacket over you.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
What happened afta that?
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
What's that, son?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
Children, come here...
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
I just got out here!
But, Nathan--
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Montana.
Pillow.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
I hate the environment.
I said -
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Oh yeah.
Uhh...
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Yeah, I guess.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Yeah!
YOU BASTARD!!
It isn't fair!
How do we do that?
I don't know, dude.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Okay...
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
I sure did, Phillip!!
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
What's the matter, Wendy?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Very professional of you.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
The device has stopped responding.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Good help is hard to find...
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Will you shut up already?
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I don't know.
Just considering our options... sir.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Close every door behind you!
I understand.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Words to live by.
No...
What?  What are you talking about?
Taylor!  Where are you?
Barnes?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
And so far.
He's in the bathroom.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
You're not from around here, are you?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
No kiddin'.
Wish me luck.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Who's there?
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What if he wants to get out?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
What does he do?
Can I ask you something personal?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Sheila, please.
You're here.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Tell me what happened Theo.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
I can't...
Would you wait a minute?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What do we use for defense?
Captain.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
-- and then brought her down here --
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
Nothing, sir.
In the ship, sir.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
What?
You don't know that.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
What -- are you threatening me?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
And you didn't tell anyone?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
In Edmunds' things.
You, me and Harry?
Four days?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
The refridgerator.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
But how?
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
I'll just boost the doses.
Doesn't say.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
Where are you?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's not safe for you to be either.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
C'mon --
You hear that?
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Yes you are...
Fine.  I'm fine.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
That's right.
How far away's the sub?
I'm trying.  There.
What is it, Harry?
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Huh?
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Not that I know of.  Why?
You seen my suitcase?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
I'm not going out there.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
What's that?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
What are you saying?
Don't you believe it.
Come back here... Where are you going?
With four casualties?!
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
I didn't see him !
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
I got Games & Theory.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Zander, please... Let's go !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
I'll go for that.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
You're the best.
No thanks, Diz.
I'm on it !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir...
Who's that with you ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Cover us, Ace !
<U>Answer</U>!
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
You asked my opinion, sir.
No!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Ten seconds....
Thrusters at station keeping...
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Any reply from them?
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
You bet your life.
The people in New Hampshire.
"Anguish."
I beg your pardon?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Yes...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
<u>How</u>...?
Would you go in...
Later on.
I hurt you?
No, that's true.
That's something a man could do...?
Sleep well?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Carla was in the car, right?
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
What are they offering?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.

...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, this is Mr...

Arrest him.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
What?
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Why?

The girl was in the car.
So be it.

What did you say to them...?
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...

No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I live.  In the same country.
Well.  It's for you.
I bet.
Not with my mouth open.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Good.  That's very good.
Here.
Thank God for that!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Then have a donut --
Where are you, anyway?
That's Rache's song!
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
You dying.
And when did that pass?
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
Because you don't really seem here.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What did you do?
I was in there in him.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
But it's not on the schedule!
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
Fine, forget it.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
How's she doing with Brad?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
That's not wh...
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
What do I have that you don't?
You ride with Annabelle...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Not yet.
I think so...What do you think?
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
What if he is?
What?
Thanks, Scoob.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
Poison gas.
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
What's tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Oh. What happens now?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Your story was terrible!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
The same. Same as what?
Yeah?
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Who is this?
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Is it loaded?
Yeah?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
So where'd you get in?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Why? Are we going dancing?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
Even better.
He's in there...
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
How much do they have?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Give that back to me.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Condition Red!
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Yes, sir.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
And if that were true?
I know that, sir.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Where, sir?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
But we can't communicate with the base.
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
They're coming in now.
General, stick to the point, please.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
War.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Forget it.
Shoot, Lothar.
That's what I said.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Let me check.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Mm-hm.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Yes.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, when's he coming?
No I quit.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
And your mom.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Sorry.
No, he's not with a girl.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No. Life is too short.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
You know?
Erica is in the van back there.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Yeah.
Alright, Pony!
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
You could do it.
A reel?
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
It's nice here. It's different.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Oh, yeah?
You cut off your little finger?
Erica.
It's a mistake to think that.
I'm sorry.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Because I'm alienated.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Yes.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
I don't know.
This is my home.
I don't know.
Look, why do you care, huh?
You could've come over.
Man?
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
So you can give me more shit?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
So what do you wanna do?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Mm.
Wait, away?
Shit, Jeff!
Well, what about us?
Oh, fuck it, man!
Yeah, they could be songs.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Like?
You do not!
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
That's because I am.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Whatever.
Don't do that.
Your manager?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
She thinks you went to the police.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Ammo?
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
In a deep freeze.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
I'll take it.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I had a teacher like that once.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
If you please.
It must be my new shampoo.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
You bet.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
I'll come early tomorrow.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
You think this is all very funny.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
That's what I told them.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
And she's turned you into a servant.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
No?
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
But where?
He will be. In about five minutes.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
You love me?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
What's that?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Miss what?
I don't see why not.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
What?
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
You vicious--
Yeah.
Supergirl?
Why George, are you proposing?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Why didn't you tell me?
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
This is all your clothes?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
I'd love to.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
I know.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Why?
Better than when I was a child.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad Wilson.
The kid needs a man to show him --
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Can I help?
Anyday...
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
What kind?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
So where is all them half-centses?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
One.  And a half.
Columbia.
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
It was hot!
Whoopee.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Diet soda?
Missing????
Today coffee----
We can get to work on that oil!
Yeah. I'll check.
Maybe I could try --
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
What??
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
I like worrying about you.
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
A parka.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
What's a curl?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
And I will lead.
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Like me?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
An angle?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Albert!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Not really, no.
But otherwise it's swell.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Besides that.
I'd better get you down.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Even that would be an improvement.
He's from another world.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
La de da da...
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
I didn't bring any  --
What are you going to do to him?
Lex is going bye-bye.
I mean the other one!
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Two.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
He will be odd, different.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
195 pounds.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
And garbage doors.
And what does he do again?
Are you still in touch?
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
That's okay.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Oh.  Right.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Why?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Yes.  He does.
Anything you didn't understand?
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Oh.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
The people in the town?
So he was mean?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I'm absolutely positive.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Thank you, Nicole.
What do they do?
No.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Yes.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Do you have the blood test?
Poached salmon.
Yes.
Who are you?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Please.
In what way?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Before the actual accident?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
It's okay.
But Charlene...
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Why, has he bothered you before?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
He means that much to you...?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
But not for anything I did today...
Talk to her yourself...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
You're sure.  Find out for me.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
- that's what I mean!
I know you do, Sidney.
If you want me to -
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
We stick in each others craw.
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Can I stop by my house?
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
I don't know.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
No. Ours was damaged.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I would like to go now, please.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
How?
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Of course I know what that is.
How could I know what's in the archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
He did?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
I'll do the same for you sometime.

You must have a girlfriend.
What's it to ya?
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Not possible.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
A girl.  You know.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I just called.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Then, you kiss his ass.
What... is... happening... ?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
It was a gift... from my brother.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
That one did.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Seriously?  What did they say?
I thought...
God, wake up, it's a con!
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
That's a lie...
All I mean is... someone like you...
It's out of your hands.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
We searched the house.
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Shut up!
No...
Like... where are you from?
Boyfriend?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
I said I would...
I'll call them, okay?
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
No, thank you.
Physical?
It's all down to this...
Guess!
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Goodnight then.
Did you worry about him?
Where's my brother?
The Hinchberger wedding.
What about the house?
Yeah.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
Like she smelled it too?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
How'd I know it was for you?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
No.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I'm not.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
We all did.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Huh?
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Yeah?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Snuffed her.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
You goin' back inside?
What post office?
Didn't get it.
It was the bars, then.
Try calling me again.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
It didn't discourage you, though.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Get seven years, did you?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
And that is?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
There is?
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
What are you doing here?
Sure you do.
Are you finished?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Yes. Thank you.
And you should tell Doris...
Yeah. Thanks.
Hello, Tony.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
That right.
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
I can get it, yeah.
And how do we share--
Maybe.
Right! Strictly business.
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
So?
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
...I don't think so.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
So--
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Ah.
They sent us to tell ya.
It better be good.
Great.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Yes.
Like hell!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
Oh.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
I'd say we're in its home.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
You're right.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Not that big.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
I have to shoot.
Today.
You want to book the flight?
What's to see?
What's on the ClockCam?
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Of course.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Yeah?  Outta what?
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
How do you know?
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
What?!
So why do you want to go?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Truman, stop it!
It looks so small.
You got it.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
You're not FBI agents.
Penetration but not perforation.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
He just let it explode.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Do you?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Where are you, Mulder?
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Where are we?
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
About the conspiracy?
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I'll be fine.
I don't need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
What did you see?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Like hell "wait."
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
No problem.
No.  Thank you.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Already there.
You're kidding me.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Completely unaware.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He has a little dog.
He was Harry's driver?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Tell you what?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Where is she?
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wait here.
He told you, didn't he?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
I'm sorry.
Of course.
There's nothing in them.
And my passport?
No.
No.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Holly...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You can get somebody else...
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Will you give me...
What's the name of this girl?
Must be some mistake.
What does he say?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
And?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Just take it, OK.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So?
A fin!
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
I'm sorry.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Just don't.
I have a job.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Are they still together?
Oh, really?
He's at a home out here.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
What assholes.
Where are they?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Don't curse in front of it.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
A poison...?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
No.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Don't tell me what I --
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
What is happening?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
So what do we do with the device?
What are you trying to say?
"Do chickens give milk?"
No.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
What?
What do you mean?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
I said that the file is incomplete.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
You're right.  You're fired.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Checking out the competition.
Don't.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
And where did you say you were from?
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
What is it?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
I don't know... why?
... The way she moves.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
Then, tell me a story.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
He doesn't hear too well.
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
... Sally?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Sure. Why not.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
We go to the same temple.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Why not?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Go on -—
Tomorrow -—
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Hey —— I'm over here.
Good evening.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
About Charlie's leopard?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
That was a calamity!
I thought they came right past here ——
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
You're too good to me.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
You... You found that at Leon’s?
There’s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
Excuse me?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
How... When did you...
Is there anything to understand?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Something like that?
Simplify and damn.
To get me killed...?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Do you know a friendly cop?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What?
What kids?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
What if it is?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Uh-huh. You could’ve waited for me inside.
Shut up and drive!
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I’m sorry...
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
I didn’t think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I don’t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I’d have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
What do you think, huh?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Costliest!
Louis... water and fresh straw!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Well...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But it is what I want.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
And?
Why?
Scared of a girl?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not long ago...
The voice was in your cell?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
I... I can't stop her.
But... her army's so small now...
You did well...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
For what?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
The bridge won't wait!
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Don't swear...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
No.
I -- I -- I...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why not?
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
So your memory's coming back?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Really?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
No, I...
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Yes, it is.
Him?
Why did she have to die?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I want to be at one with Him now.
He'll be back before curfew.
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What's happened?
What?
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
I've no money.
Yes, please.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
We use what?
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
They were taking you away.
You'll be deported.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
No sound at all?
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
What's the line on Visitation?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
No.
Here.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
That's the way I want it.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Forget it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
You sober?
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
We'll get by without 'em.
Neither are we.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Did he say he wouldn't?
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Who are you?
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Yeh, sleepin'.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, when?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You got a system, Carver?
I don't know, figure something out.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Come on, gimme a break.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
It's the same one.
What are you talking about?
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Go away!
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
You see how much we have to say.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
I know -- I know --
Only in bad weather.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
That woman!
Not a thing.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
No.
He's holding out on you.
I think we're on the right track.
Nunheim!
Rosebreen.
--was Wynant's.
Well....
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
They were kidding you.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Is that another Christmas present?
I don't believe he did it.
Not with all your money!
He was down in the shop.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
I don't know.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
I just wanted to tell you...
Y-yes.
It's a fortune box.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
So we wait.
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe we should split it up now.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
It's a combat action.
No.
Get out of my way.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
What about Jaeger?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
There might be.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.
I heard it.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
We're not going to do anything.
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
What?
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
And you; you've got it all together.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
How do we do that?
Somebody has to.
Thanks.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
He's going to slow down.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Like I said; so?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
What happened?
Eat your dinner.
What?
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Incredible!
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
Where's LUH?
Right now.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
No!....
What do you want?
Yes...
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Hey, look--
You mentioned something called Redstone.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
Hey, I'm next.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
What was it this time?
I'll do it.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I promised her she'd be safe.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
About tonsils.
No.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Thank you.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
But not now.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
I know it!
The tennis player?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Monescu!
Gaston!
Sweetheart, what day is today?
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
But, Lily--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
I know that niche.
Oh!
Yes.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
Yes!
Right!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
And so will M'sieu Giron.
How do you like my dress?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
I know it.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Adolph J. Giron.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Goodbye.
Divine ...
No, m'sieu!
I know!
Jacques!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
I beg your pardon!
Then why did you do it?
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
No, but we're making excellent time.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I see you.
Au contraire, mon cher.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Right.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
There's soft music--
Well, I can't.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Don't let's talk about it.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Shortie, look!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
My change.
Now you're talkin'!
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
I'm sorry to hear that.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Cut it out.
Next month is June.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Never mind.
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Are you happy?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Get that out of your trunk.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
What for?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Good night!
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
It all depends on what you're used to.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Absolutely nothing.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
We're gonna get along just fine.
Well... 'bye.
No...
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Revenge?  For what?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Good God, you're really-
I made a promise.
I know.  Me neither.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did.  Well... thank you.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
'Least you admit it.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I'm on my way.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Where can I find him?
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Who knows? Fog, night...
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
They point, I shoot.
Of course.
I hope so.
What do you mean?
Trust me.
We blast through.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
What do you make of all this?
Captain Morton.
I was an attorney!
No.
- I told you! He was there! -
...I see.
Approaching the first gate.
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
It's Bond!
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
We got the same thing.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Oh here we go with that.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Go back to sleep.
It would be nice.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Where is Skip?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Whadda ya think?
Yeah!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Yes, I can.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
I'd better take a look anyway.
No.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
What?!
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
I dunno.
What?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Nothing.
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Sir!  No Sir!
Last present!
What?!
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
But you're Irish!
I like plaits.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
You're not so old yourself!
I'm cold.
In my pocket.
No.
Nine thousand dollars.
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl --
It's so frustrating.
This is different.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Me, too.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Not yet.
What do you think?
Will we get invited to the White House?
You can't make me.
I'm third in my class.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Who do you work for?
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
That thought makes me feel awful.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
I don't know.  Something.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
What is the name of your informant?
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Ssshh!
Right. You can't sleep here.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Can I see you again?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You're too young.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
It's an interesting theory.
What happened?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
No.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Director?
Who wrote it?
I don't rate that at all.
It was my fucking television.
Are you serious?
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
Yeah.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
So what's it going to be?
A walk.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
My pain?
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
A Federation starship.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
The emergency channel, open.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
I'm afraid of nothing.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Spock...
  
He's not?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
I don't get it.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I'm certainly not.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
How about you?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Come here.
You're getting out of the business?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
That's all going to change, Yori...
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
Then I owe you some thanks...
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Where's Flynn?
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Okay, Dad.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Just hang a minute.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
The purse is still at the house.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Sure.  Say that now.
What did you tell him?
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
Uh huh.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
Do you still love your husband?
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Yes or no.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Is it working yet?
Yup.										*
No.  But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
And you've got one.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
And you chased one?
I'm married!
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Helen.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
I didn't get any chicken.
The letter he sent.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What are your turn-ons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Five.
She OD'd, didn't she?
A real live pimp?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Yeah.
Now tell him goodbye.
It'll get ya high.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
What's to think about?
Let me handle this.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
We grew up together.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Do you still have friends on the force?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Keep it.
No.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
I believe he believes him.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
You do.
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Change what?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
James, why don't we...?
What's the matter with your leg?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
The gun! ... I lost it
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
You... you left them a message?
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Christ no!
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
I think I've heard that before.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
You don't fear death?
More or less.
Same back at you.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Nothing.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Hundred and eight already.
Will be.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
How much?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
You believe that?
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
You got beer?
Yes.  Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
John--
Wrong number.
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
I just drove in this morning.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess it must.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Games?
You know what I want.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Whatever it takes.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to take the money.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
But you said we could be together.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
Where the hell am I going to go?
Someone will find me.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would you kill her?
Hungry?
No.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
The time wasn't right.
SHUT UP!
Darrell giving you problems?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
What are you babbling about?
I said come on!
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
What's your name anyway?
Get away from me!
You expect me to believe that?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
And you're taking?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You want something, old man?
Christ no!
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
You afraid of the dark?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Grace, tell him.
Like you don't know.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a madman.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Will you shut up!
Get away from me!
You own this place?
How much time?
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
A medicine man?
The same thing you do.
Like you.
Beautiful?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I busted my leg!
'Cause I love you.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
One way, or round trip?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
No! No! Please!
You didn't hear something?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Four.
What did I say?
Yes. Is this David?
Jesus.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
You've misunderstood.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I won't make any noise.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
Two hundred and seventy.
I'm not scared.
How did you get together?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
She back in Kansas?
Be careful with those, sonny.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
No?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Yup.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I could run off them whores.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He's... he's dead.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
A sign on him?
N-no, sir?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn't...?
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Sure. Sure, Bill.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
This Kid, what's he like?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
More.
I ain't blind, you asshole.
We'll bury him.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
Bear with me here...
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Edie, please.
A glass of water would be nice.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
They fucking know everything.
Dig.
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
I work for Keyser Sate.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Kobayashi.
I know he was good.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
Why didn't you say anything?
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
He wanted me to live.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Immunity.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
... tell me about this case.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Yes.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Neurology?
Orthopedics?
What book is that?
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
Nothing further, your Honor.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I...
That's not my handwriting.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
And you wrote that...
Thank you.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Then why don't you testify?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Yes.  Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Yes.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
No...no...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What do you want?
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
I'm swell.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
I don't want a mistrial.
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... I understand ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
I did.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
Huh.  And why is that?
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
You won't have to.
Why?
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
They're none of them right.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Yes. Yes, I do.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
Can't you see?
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
We'll find him.
Do you remember where you were?
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
No.
What?
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Well... anywhere in particular?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Long ago...
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
It's all there. It's no dream.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
And it's a all real.
Why?
Please let me go.
What is her name?
What car?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
What a pleasant hobby.
Could be.
My... the acrophobia.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
Carlotta?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Sorry Fish.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
What are you fucking talking about?
Eat my ass!
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
At the seven-eleven.
It has worked.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know and I'm honored...
What.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
The groom?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
I'm not talking to you?
Give me two more.
Nobody knows.
Shut up Boyd.
What is the question you asked me?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Moore?
New king.
What's your point?
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
The wedding cake check?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
How much?
Okay.
Not padded ones.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Can we just talk this out?
No.
The prostitute.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What does that mean?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
What does that mean?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Go for it.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
The wahoo moment?
I think so.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
The stone age.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Stop this!
You cannot leave ...
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
When you are, miss.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Whatever.
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
On my life, I promise you I will.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
What's the assignment?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Not from in here.
Don't remind me.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Then fix it.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
That's not true, Parker.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
I know who would know.
I'm still working on it.
As a matter of fact, it is.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Tell him.
I'm doing the best I can!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
For Schumann.
It's <u>producing</u>.
...can we have a white one...?
Indeed it is.
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
...where?
Come on.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
...they just hadn't thought it through...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Quite touching.
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Where is he?
Heavy weather East of here.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Dartmouth
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
"Back End" ... count on it.
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
They got him standing by.
...that's right.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Big mistake.
...givem what they want...But...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
You got a dime....?
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Fine.  Good.
Jim Belushi...?
Show some compassion.
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Coulda been a contender.
About what?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Don't start, alright.
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
You sure?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, right...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
What? How do you know about my father?
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
You're learning, sport...
How much?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Obviously...
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
I'll let you know.
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
...how do you know? You wish...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
With Mark?
He still likes you
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
What's that?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Good evening sir.
She went to a waxwork party
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Well divide 18 into three
It's only two hours away.
Your husband?
No.
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
Your friend saw them.
That can't feel good.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
I have to go.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Very much.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
You know where she is?
Please leave me alone.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
We know each other.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Well good.  So you're human.
This.
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Adamant?
It's Saturday.
I am, really.
We did.
I know.
Yep.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Shhhh.
What am I looking at?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...Don't get all...
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
The accident...?
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Yep.
In the living room...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
STOP IT!
What?
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
To Caitlin!!
It's alright.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
You don't have to do that.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
I want to see my mother.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I had you sent away.
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
He just went out like & light-
If you knew how I yearn for that...
I LOVE him!
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hello..
I don't think of us that way - ever.
A little wine...?
No.    This is unreal...
Gotcha.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
BRIAN...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Yes - I have had it for years.
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
I don't know...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Did you?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
No thanks - 
It's what you would do to me
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What's this all about?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
I'll be sure to...
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Let me get this straight...
These are real, live women?
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We miss our family.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
My legacy.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
Your dad taught you everything.
Let's do it.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I see.
Not a chance.
But absolutely true.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Yellow pages?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
You're sure?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
You were the new and improved you.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Then what?
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Unless what?
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Why is that?
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
You are.
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Hi, Mon.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
God, I've been calling you.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
You got something against cigarettes?
That's right.  That was his name.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
That was the same thing Ray said.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Jim West.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Is this leading somewhere?
Starting with a screw?
Yes.  Now, observe....
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Fine, I'll stop.
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
I deal with some tough customers.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
The first.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Then come with us.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You're not a woman.
I will!  But I need help!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Friend of yours?
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Want me to carry Elora?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Are you scared?
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Kill him!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Just do it!
Madmartigan.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Cows. You know, cows?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Something wrong with buttons?
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was.
You're so sure of that?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Where's my baggy pants?
Johnny, what the fuck?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
I admit I don't know where he is.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
But... if you had to guess?
John said you're Amish.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
You are acting like one!
You shame yourself.
Lean on him.
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
No --
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Oh!  Well....
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Why --
No, they won't - honestly.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
What's she doing now?
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh, you....
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh - I'll get it!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Oh, my!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Oh, come on.
Huh?  What'd he say?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Did I scare you?
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It's too late!  There they....
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
I don't know.
Fine.  He's got a plan
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Whozat?
Not nohow!
A heart --
Let's.
You know something?
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
We'll get you together!
Come on, fellows!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
So who are you?
It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Who?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
The inside man?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Partially, yes.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
You’re not going to.
I know.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Could...could you come?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
I won't do that.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I¹m not.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Don't look.  Turn around.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
That's because --
Where did he go?
Everything's changed --
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
That's exactly why we need them.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You can't talk to it?
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Into the Hudson?
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
He takes himself seriously.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is it enough?
ALIVE.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
What was your grandfather's name?
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Baack!
Baack!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Love me oodles and oodles?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Good.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Why did you do that?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
How old are you, young man?
But, sir...
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
What hump?
I wonder what's got into them?
Did you hear that strange music??
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
How?
What?
Don't fall for that one.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
Can you play it?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I'll bet it's a doozy.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
What do you think we should do?
I think so.
Good night!
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Three minutes to go!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
But will they make good use of them?
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
