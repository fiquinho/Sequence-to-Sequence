Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
You got something on your mind?
The "real you".
Who?
Neat...
You are so completely unbalanced.
You did what?
But
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
What about him?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
You makin' any headway?
Where ya goin?
A hundred bucks a date.
Are you lost?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
William didn't even go to high school
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Who?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Like you could find one
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I thought you were above all that
So what did I have an effect on ?
The duck?
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is that right?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
What's to discuss?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I haven't given you much of a life.
You don't usually ask.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
Chief says -- he has a God.
God... That's in a week!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Passion is something one cannot control!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Thank you.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Don't say anything.
...delusions and paranoia.
What about Oleg?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
Now I become custody of police department?
They're not gonna send you right back.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Yeah, right.
When?
Yeah.
What are you saying?
You know what that is, right?
I don't even watch TV.
You goin' to the escort service?
Why not?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Alright.
Stop it.
Okay.  You ready?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Let her go!  Let her go!!
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Get in the bathroom!
No, I don't get that!
Emil???!
Yes, the money is good.
Well, he...
I'm here for movies.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
How was it?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
It's possible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Hal?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
CONTINUED
She's in the bathroom.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Any clue as to what it is?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
How about chargin' the battery?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Hey, this works pretty good.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
They saved your ass, convict.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Why?
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Jack?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
What am I wanted for?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You sure you want me to?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hard man to live with.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
When?
Five.  On credit.
Corn-i-Lius?
No thank you.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
He's a she!
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Good luck..
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
They really made her...
So, just how big was this fare?
...Ma???
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Six to the left. One to the right.
It's my wife.
Love...
Finished what?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Tell me...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
This is all that survived?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Got it.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
You couldn't?
What?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
A fellow investor.
And they are?
We can do that.
Machine's in?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Any good?
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
Don't ask questions.
What do you want?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Yeah.
Tell me what happened.
Where?  Show me where.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
Specialty product.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
He succeeded.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It won't work like that.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
No.
How... how can you say that to me...?
I remember.  You just left...
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
I can't go back to sleep again.
You in a hurry?
Is there something we can do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Hey...wake up.
She doesn't want me around
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Alice...
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Did everyone call everyone?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
You think that's the place she's buried?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I thought about that.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
What is it?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Reef!
I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
We're stuck tight!
You hear that?
Dave - !
Yes, Griff?
Why do you say that?
Under <u>water</u>?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Twombley involved?
Tell me.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You heard the news.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
We bought you.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
They said.
You stayed away?
Where'd you get the blood?
I just think you used to be bad.
It's stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No.
Yes.
Okay.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Okay. She's fine.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Where... how'd you hear that?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Where's Ma?
Rolfe.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Well, it was an accident.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
They aren't answering their hails.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Stand by.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you know of my husband?
My husband is a very courageous man.
Yes
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
You give me ulcers.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
IT'S OPEN!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
I was reading too.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Oveur.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted!  What are you...?
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Not now, Elaine.
You mean...
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Maybe.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Yeah.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Do you want to talk about it.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Well...not for another two hours.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Elaine!
Ted!
I just don't want to go over it any more.
What's the matter?
I love you, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Why did you do it?
Uh, Matthew...
Tell me.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Yeah... I know the routine.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
To the... to the beach?
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
That where Anderson worked?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
What?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
...We're coming in.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
The corner!  Ready?
Well you're not reading it right!
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Locked.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
What did you say?
I don't want you for a friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
They're dead.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...Mommy?
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What did you think of the music?
Don't bother!
Oh - excuse me!
What??
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
And how will you make him keep it?
Now?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Em iram! Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Then he didn't send you?
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Tonight?
What for?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
How much will you pay him?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Behold!
Gertrude!
Really?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Of course not.
Really?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, sir.
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
Pupils?
Good morning, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
German!
What?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Whom did they choose?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
I'm afraid not.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
Are you neglecting my request?
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
I think so.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
And that's all?
And that's it. Do you have it?
You mean in Turkey?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
About what?
So?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Here I am, my angel.
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Who is she?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
David?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
How old are you?
What?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'm a werewolf.
Closet.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
The next corner we can get a cab.
Jack is dead!
How are we feeling tonight?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
She's a jerk.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Go on, ask them.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
What's the plan?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm going completely crazy.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Get out of here, Jack!
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
What here?
What's that?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
No kidding?
How much?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
Well—
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
I'm not interested in what you think.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
I don't know.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
No, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Well, I—
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh, Matt . . .
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
No. It wasn't earlier because...
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
He's smiling.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
Bob. I didn't...
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
So what do we do, General Lee?
The James-Younger Gang.
It's not a bank.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Strategically.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
My little Web did that?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
"Big and older"?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
What do you think?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
This has been a good year.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Riders --
Where will you find such a girl?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Stop it. This is just sad.
What?
Tennessee?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
You been with a girl ever?
They had to be dealt with!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Really!
How much did they get from the safe?
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Eight?
J&B. Straight.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Patrick?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Everybody's rich.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
We need to talk.
Good coloring.
Yes, naturally.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Lucky, I guess.
Patrick?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Who?
Where did you go to school?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Hang...out?
We were both seven in 1969.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
No.
Yes.
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
Yeah, well, you're late.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Yes, Owen?
You are a fanatic.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
That took some fun out of --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I can't just walk away!
I remember.
Guilt?
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
He wasn't acting?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Keep looking.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
...Were you?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
A what?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
I don't know --
That's lame, isn't it?
Jesus, Teddy.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Yes?
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Yes?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Oh, and Austin...
Excuse me?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
That does not compute.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Oh, yes you are.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Not in the Nineties.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I'll hurry back.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Danger's my middle name.
Everything seems to be in order.
Don't mind if I do.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
He's asleep.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Love...
... love...
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Who?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
I wasn't about to.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
Do you always drive this fast?
Barely.
You followed me.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
What kept you?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Steed
Possibly. Split personality ...
John Steed.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
I've decided not to run for President.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Yes, sir, I am.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Let go of me!
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
No, Brett, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
What's this?
He look familiar?
Reach out and snort someone.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You gotta let me finish --
I like what you've done with the place.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Goddamn it Stephen!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Well, you did invite me here.
Okay.
Got anything to drink in there?
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Homey.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
That's a dumb thing to say.
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Who's doing this?
Then who --
The outlets.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
I don't guess.
But he killed these guys.
Did I say thanks?
No need to be modest, Brian.
Engine 115, right?
Coffee sucked.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
"Don?"
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
Yeah.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Large?
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
What case?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Let's go niggers!
Well you did.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
You don't have the demographics.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
What do I have to do?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm feelin' dis'!
Yep, you guessed it.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Who are the other characters?
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
He never showed it.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
What point is that?
Sounds risky to me.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Just want to say good luck.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
How's the food?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
You've never had any formal training, either?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...too early...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
What else?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
The coward!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
No.
Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Agreed.
I feel the ribbon.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
He loves me, as I love you.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
You shot Childs and Nunez.
He -- He made me do it --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Why?
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
But not the only victim, right?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
I didn't kill him --
Is it the truth?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Nevertheless --
You mean not enough to save you.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You knew Sergeant West?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You and the Colonel go back.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
We're fucked, I know --
You couldn't have known --
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Hardy, what are you doing --
No bodies, no West...
That's not true.
Really.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Wait --
I used it to start the fire --
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Or are you too scared?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I'll...
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Did you do any of that?
Really.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
You don't even know me.
How can I convince you to stop?
Hello.
Yes.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Yes.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
The sets were good.
Do you want to stop?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Right.
What did he say?
She says she has a secret to tell.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
No. It is too judgmental.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Yes.
"Frenzy".
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
So now you hate all women?
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
I don't want anyone to die.
No. I think I better just go.
What does it mean?
What are you doing?
Hey.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Hey.
She's around. Always is.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
You gonna steal my truck?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Better?
I deserve better than this.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
LAZ, I said let...!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Two days?
Well I don't...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
What?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Sorry.
I don't want you to let go.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
How a girl get like that?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
What happened to your face?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Thought you had a man for that.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What's this?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
What are they doing now?
Frank Abolofia.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Joyce can be nice.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why weren't you at the platform?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Where does this Sugai live?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Nick, you can't do this.
No.
Someone attacked him.
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
Who am I supposed to be?
Keep the change.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Yeah.
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
It's not your job.
He killed a police officer.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
You had my help, detective.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Good.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Show me something?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
He could?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
I was just about to have my dinner.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Why, yes, of course.
Okay, but...
And what in your estimation works?
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
You want to see my friends?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Money?
You're going to be over the limit.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
I'd never get an abortion.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
You know what I think?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Yes.
How do you know I'm not?
What desert?
A tortoise.  What's that?
Of course.
How come you were in my truck?
Pris.
What's that?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
How do you do?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
You're lost?
What's wrong with you?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Right.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I think it's the eyes.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
I didn't know that.
They're all divorced?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
In the house?
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
No.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Is this because of the radiation?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Tempus fugit!
No, son. A pitcher.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
But, I don't understand.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
So, did you buy a movie?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Good-bye, Adam.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Say what?!
Right.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
No.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
The locks.
Mutants?!
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Just be yourself.
To bed.
Yes, you do.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
What do you want to do with it?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Yeah! That's thinking.
I don't know. I like to think so.
We came back to the house!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Buy it from me?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
You're all through with this now?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
See my nipples?
Do you know?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
You like to open me, don't you?
Shut up.
I did. Are you?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Go where?
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah, I know.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Hi Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
So, what's next?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Yeah.
He got a little jealous.
Did you see her undressed?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
What am I going to do?
Jeffrey!!
Yeah.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You want to dance?
No.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
You think they sold me out? No way.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
We're alive.
Aye.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
He got beat up by a girl.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
What?
Nine bodies.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
How do you figure?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Promise me boys.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Roc. You okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
Has he now?
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Have you no fear of God?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
I'm lookout.
Yeah, I heard that.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
You think we're going to be chased?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Obviously. That's a given.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
He went back for his brother.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I don't think we can do that.
Shh.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Who's Mr. Henry?
What do you think?
As a person?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Freeze!
I don't know.
Wait for Kumar.
You got to be kidding me.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
Does it float?
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
That was a test?
We're renegades from despair.
Future Man.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Are you serious?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Jesus, Bob.
No.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
The front stairs.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Not even for emergencies?
They are.
That never would of --
OK, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You're paranoid, Bob.
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What are you doing?
Way to go, Bob!
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Watch me.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
You don't even know his name.
Applejack drove.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
What's the story?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You a good pool player.
Treadstone.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
What?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
Pamela Landy?
-- it hasn't been two years --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I know it's a dream.
What is this, a game?
It's me.
What?
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
Anything?
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
We must sue for peace.
Young Robert, we are honored --
The Scots will fight for us?
But if we have not caught Wallace --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Test of manhood.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I want... to marry you!
Nor I!
Why did you?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
No.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
I... I blacked out.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
What does that mean for Evan?
Straight up.
Dad lives here?
Are you hurting her?
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
It was a long time ago.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
I was?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
We'll find out soon enough.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Listen to me good, Evan...
Lung cancer?
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Meant no offense.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
How long have you been married?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Goodnight.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Suppose we do.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I will.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Uh huh.
My German's a little rusty.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
Be careful.
How do you do?
What for?
Your work.
Good evening.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Oh, no, Rick never --
What friend?
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You think of everything, don't you?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Just a little something of my own.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Yeah, a long one.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Merry Christmas eve.
No.
There isn't any us.
What was inside?
Yeah?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Anything else?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Which I didn't have.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
How'd it go?
And never take.
You are one sick fucker.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Cool ropes.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
And that I can drive a truck!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
At least you were never lonely.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
How is that Wally doing?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Is *your* father dead?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Have you enlisted?
It's almost like flying.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
What's that? What's it called?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
First pregnancy?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Of course.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm not in trouble.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
That's *it*?
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
So, what do you do?
Can --
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Everything looks in order.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Nice.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
After you cut her loose.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
It can buy you a new and better you.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Eight A.M. flight.
So that's it...
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
How much?
Stake you?
Excuse me?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What is this? You guys cops or something?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Mr. King, I think --
Why?
I gotta go get a haircut.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
You tell them the "Tale".
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Uh...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
It's not history.
Speak.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Did he buy it?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I don't gamble.
You want me drunk?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
You're my prisoner.
How did it go?
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Then what?
Why did you take the money?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
What happened?
I owe a lot of money.
Who's they?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
I'm sorry.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
How are you?
I'm Lucy.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
And the girls?
I put them on together.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
I don't think so.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Girlfriend?
Where's the fail-safe key?
It didn't go off.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Hey, bomb...
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
Why don't you have more time?
Any of 'em any good?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
You know what I think about, Talby?
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Not now!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
No kidding?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
I'm on a break.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
How're ya doin', Max.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
What're you looking for?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
So what are you gonna do about it?
That would be appropriate, yes.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
You believe that?
What's this?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Who are you?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
As long as you're okay.
How's this about me?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
A little what?
Please...
So are dogs.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
I'm a toy to her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
I was on call. 
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Huh?
What the hell is that?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
I-I c-can't...
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Dude, this is all I got.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Yeah.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Is that your final answer?
Good morning, mongrels!
What happened?
What was his name?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Yeah?
Why?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Hey. You OK?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
No. Frank.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
People aren't that simple.
Oh, shit!
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
His name is Frank.
I think about girls a lot.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
If God exists?
What is going to happen?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
I... What can we do?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Christ. Is that an axe?
But now you can't go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Where is she?!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Oh shit!
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Mom!
Bye mom.
I just did.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
That's enough!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Send for my car...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What's the matter with you?
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
My card.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Are you getting tired?
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's even a greater honor.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
You worm!
Yes.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Well, these things take time.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
You don't own this man!
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Yes, I think I can.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Are you comfortable here?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Three quarters of an hour.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Oh no?
y-y-yes--
Oh, yes.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
My name is...
My... name is...
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness...
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh no, I couldn't.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
I said welcome.
Those things in your hands.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Five this week; how many the week before?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
I shouldn't have come.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
But you don't want to hear it.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
You don't love ME.
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
What a stupid idea.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Faster!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
What "magic"?
I've got you!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
He hasn't.
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
My brother blacksmiths!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
Dad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well... I'm game.
Yes, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
Come up to Boston with me?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
How are you today?
I'm sorry.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
It's okay, really.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
I don't have one.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Well, I should probably get going.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
You should stay.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What do you mean?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
It's very late.
You know what I did.
Me too. There's this poem --
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah.
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Hey, Joel --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Oddly enough, I do.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
How's it going?
That's me.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
What? What do you mean?
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I miss you.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
We'll speak soon.
That's a good one.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
What?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Hi.
Mary...
Yes?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
I tried that already.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Yeah?
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
A traveler, eh?
Tell me about it.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Whose fault was that?
What are you doing?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Holy shit...
But Justin...
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
It's holding... She's holding...!
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What is it?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
What's wrong?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Thank you.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
It's 2041...
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
You... You can't do that!
What are you talking about?
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
What's causing the readings?
Maybe one of the original crew?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I'll do it --
He's been past Mars?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Hey...
Claire is your wife?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What about his first born?
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
Isn't that your speech?
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Where... where am I?
What?
You're hot!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
Leonard, how's the feed?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
What?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Are you kidding?
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
You want to work at Carl's?
Totally.
This is how I dress all the time.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Any problems?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Are you really a virgin?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
All right.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
It was nice.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
That little prick.
That little prick.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Thanks. So do you.
It's very warm out tonight.
I think I better take you home.
We keep them.
You keep them.
This is a nice car.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Killed?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Las Vegas.
Hell, no!
What?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Damn right!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GO?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
What tape?
I want that fucking radio!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Extract of pineal!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Could I have that, please?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Who the hell would you call?
Stop it.
Oh!
So, your husband ditched you?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Just an observation.
We're better off.
We gotta try.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
What is this?
Oh, no.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
My husband...
He's dead.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What's going on between you two?
Max?
'Eh, Chief?
Let's move.
DON'T!
Let's go!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
I'm not lying.
Well... come on.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Thank you --
A rich actress.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Who?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Really?
Thank you.
Good.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Aren't you ever going back?
What?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Harry... I met someone.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Huh?
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, You're crazy.
Who?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Who're you?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I'm not!
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You're an outcast.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Your decision. For us.
I've no choice
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
So do I.
No. But someday.
Are you having me on?
Only you would think of that!
They'll hang him all the same.
No. He had more important work.
Yes? And?
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Quite a place.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Cabin B is ready.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
How come you're leaving?
You know what I said, though.
What the hell?
I had to.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
That was the telephone.
How about our last jay?
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Mmmmmmmph?
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
You okay?
How much do I owe you?
Good luck.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
What's this guy's problem?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Why are you so agitated?
He backed down.
To your family.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- you got your sink --
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
I wasn't scratching!
I never said help us!
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Richie? You okay?
No.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Seth, if you were me --
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
What do you mean?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Got it.
Standing right here in my office.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
No, sir, WHAT?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
California.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You'll think about my offer?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
That bad?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
What about him.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
"Dad."
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
O'Neil...
I just wonder how that happened.
O'Neil, Jordan.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
He stole my report! That's my report!
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
So you made it.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
You never said it was off the record.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Oh, I'm not married.
Not for a long time, now.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
You gave them the tape?
Oh.
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
Why do you need that?
It's Raymond.
Thanks.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Come on, old friend...
I won't and nothing you say-
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
We've got to stop!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
About this much.
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Yes. Good was done this .....
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
What?
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
No, wait, are you-
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
never doubted you for a second.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
You have ten seconds.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Theramin.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Weapons storage...
What's going on?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Oh, right, sorry.
Because they're coming right at us.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
The army can survive without me.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Misunderstood what!?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
How old are you, Captain?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
What's your advice, Alexander?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
I'm not sure.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Lafayette is a child!
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
You think that?
Partially...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Detained by what?
Unofficially, General Greene.
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
General Lee, sir!
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Where... do those men come from, George?
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
I guess still in the locker.
You see the paper?
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
What's this movie you're doing first?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
The airport.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Or else what?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Sovereign.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
That's right.
Have we met? I don't recall.
I'm looking at you.
You make movies, huh?
But you work for the casino?
Really? You ever been arrested?
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
Really.
You have it?
Who?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
What's that?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
We call you a taxi.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
For any movie.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Hm?
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
I don't have a dog.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
How about now?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Smokes?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Went aboard.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Dodge to Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Don't lie to me!
If money can buy what he wants.
Sorry.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Stay away. Or else.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
Greer?
How's he doing?
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
What?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Victims of what?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
Pretty low all around.
Ho-ly shit.
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Who?
YES.
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Hmm.
So what do you think?
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
That guy rules!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Jesus, look at this guy.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Or maybe not.
I might actually get the pasta special.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
What are you talking about -- who?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
This is way too creepy.
Oh yeah...
We still have to go in there sometime.
Let's go hassle Josh.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where?
That rules!
Like what?
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Hello?
How repulsive!
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I said "great"...
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Well, we won't keep you.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
You're late, asshole.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
PLEASE? We have to!
For nineteen years...
Yeah, but still...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
I had to see you.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
They're Seymour's.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
No... they said she was here...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What are you talking about?
Seymour?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
John, it will not be easy.
Got me out of trouble.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
Have you got it?
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Goddammit!
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
Good luck.
The workers don't get on?
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
No, you didn't, Frank.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
-- the sorrow --
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
Hello, Venkman.
I'm Egon --
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
I'm Ray --
Like a goat on garbage.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Ready?
What?  Yeah.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
No?  What do I act like?
That's too bad.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
On a purely scientific basis.
I'll scream.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
But why?  The students love us!
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Is that a game?
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Are you Peter Venkman?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Yes, it would.
No, you may not.
Why do you want to see it?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
All right.  What is it?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Where's the Keymaster?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
I've read of it.
The Senate too?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
My troops don't make policy.
Greeks?
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Who the hell are you?
Take your hands off me animal!
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
Was she married or something?
No.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Is that him over there?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
My belt.
What are you going to do now?
But you might.
I don't know.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Yes.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Ben.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Give me an hour.
It's in the main ballroom.
Where is your luggage?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
But it's light in there now.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
When is he coming back?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Oh my God.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
No.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Would you like me to seduce you?
Get away from that door.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
May I sit down?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Well -- I don't know.
I got a single room.
Yes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Well.
Why don't you watch?
What?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
If you want.
Anything. Anything at all.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
What novel did you read.
There!
Calm down, Benjamin.
Thank you.
No.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
But you don't hate him.
No.
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Oh my God.
I have my reasons.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
I see.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Go home now.
Oh, no.
Well --
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
I know.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Yes?
The Carlsons' are here.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Not now.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
You might find a bullet through that head...
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
What?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
We'll dance.
I feel sorry for him.
You live here?
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
I can't.
On the train?
Thank you, sir.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I've no luck.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
For me?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Anyone asked for me?
You're tired. I can see that.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Yes.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
What?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Of course -- of course. 
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Hurry, Suzette.
Again?
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
And if you do it wrong?
You want a drink?
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Can't move.
What? He's going to be all right!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Kaggs. Home office.
Well, uh... No.
No?
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
What happened to your hand?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
Get off the grift, Roy.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
At what?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
For God's sake, Lilly!
A future. The only future I've got.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Are you sure?
Roy?
That's just Lilly's way.
The tap. What you do for a living.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
Where?
Upstate.
Think about it. Okay?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You were gone for a while.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
No! Because I --
For Christ's sake, why not?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit?!
You sure?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Forget it.
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Can I come in?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
It's John, isn't it?
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Ooooh, busted.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Thanks!
Have enough fun for the both of us.
He do that to you?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
What if your parents come home?
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What should I do?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Where are you going?
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
It was you.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
What do you know about Michael?
No one.
Home is important to a man.
This room is full of ghosts.
You know what gets me?
I dunno, boy.
What's funny about that?
Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
I didn't know we had any women left.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Me?
You're an imbecile.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!
Ask it!
Everybody says he was so brave.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
England?
Dad was never in England?
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that.
Uck.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Play?
The smallest thing I've got.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Some kind of animal?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Disease?
Shouldn't you lie down?
A trip, you mean?
I have some change!
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
That's what you're supposed to say.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
What a handsome word.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I mean it!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
How do I load?
You've killed women?
He's dead, you know.
Oh dear.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You've been bitten by bats?
I was going to ask.
Good Lord.
I thought she was a widow.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees, you say?
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Don't shoot.
No.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
I'm only ten years old.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Something's made you sore.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Still lives with his mother.
I hate that thing.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Coming.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
Take plenty of cigars.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
You've got to fight from time to time.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
It's good.  Let him go.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
But is she, has...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Now, what do you want?
How many weeks?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Yeah.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Half now, half later.
When do we start?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
And your wife? Where's she?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
You don't understand shit.
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
That's like a stag film.
They are?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Who made it?
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
What happened, pilgrim?
What is it, Jake?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
Take it or leave it.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Maybe. Maybe not.
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Was he with a girl?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Okay, lady. Out.
None of that, lady.
No.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Eh, no. Thank you.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Look.
We'll come back in the morning.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
I like Glaucus.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Did Confucius say that?
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With God?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
How about some candy floss?
It looks like you. Thanks.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
I have a sore throat.
Mother.
What?
I don't care what people say.
How do you do?
Fifteen.
Ah, yes.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I don't know.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Yes.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Thank you, Uncle.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
The moment of truth.
Oh sure.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
O.K. Let's go.
What are you talking...
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Story of my life.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Myers??? How's your arm?
You want me to hold him down?
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Out? Out out?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
Cocky.
That you feel that way about me.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
What's the problem?
Julia's my second wife.
I have to speak to my father.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
No.
But you said --
Julia.
Tell me who you are.
No. God no.
A box?
Hell...
And the blood let you out?
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
You can't love him.
Which is where?
Kirsty? It's very late.
This afternoon.
What have you done?
Shit.
Take it slowly.
I'll be scarred for life.
Don't go upstairs.
Not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
What's wrong?
I'll get the doctor.
What did you say?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
It's like she's waiting for something.
I don't believe it.
Where are you going?
You're not going?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Oh no.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Alison's.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
Play it.
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Why would they care?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Hey.
My band.
What band?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
The little skate-fuckers.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I have all of the others.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
On Clark Street!
Hey, Barry.
Where's Rob?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
What needs sorting out?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
I suppose so.
Is what better?  Better than what?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I don't have your number.
Hello.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Don't forget your CDs.
I guess I am.
I'm sorry.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
What do you want to do?
What?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
But what?
Harder.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Hi.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Very persuasive.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Enough, Liz.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Don't you like that?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Yes.  You?
Yeah.
So so.  Up and down.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
No.
I don't follow you.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
What is it?
Get out.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Spare me the details.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You know me home.  Me name.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
What?
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I am not ready for this.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
But I did live.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
No doubt.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
We need more time.
Your name?
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Leave her alone.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What doing?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
No. Roy. Roy V.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Too hot?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
But --
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Did you give her the money?
Oh.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
Get out!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Hello, Hildy!
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure you can. Come on.
Get away, Svengali.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
What now?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind that. What's the story?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Then why are you doing it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
How about Bruce's?
Walter!
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
I think it is.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
I don't know --
Three bullets! Any good?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Goodbye, Yonson.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What do I know about Williams?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
He's harmless.
That's murder!
What went off?
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Where's the money?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Kings and sixes.
Mother!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
The what?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Is it hard?
A very fine-looking women.
Get the cops, somebody.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's he want?
Give him the you-know-what.
No, she didn't.
I don't mind.
You couldn't.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Who pays for them?
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
And Jim.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
And what's that?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Cone.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Which way?
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
A dead one.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Perfect.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Why are we stopping?
There's not enough room.
Hey, he moved.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Check this out.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
How long is that gonna take?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
I don't hear anything.
I still don't.
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Keys.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I'll go. It's my fault.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
No, just a little too old.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Turn up this road.
Jesus Christ.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oui. Perfect!
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Please let me go with you.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Progress!
Ouch. Yeah?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Three foot one.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Paper or cloth?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
All right.
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Good. Making progress.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Should I come with?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Ooka.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Ugnh.
Boys just passing through?
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Huh?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Oh, about five hundred.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Okay?
Cut.
A thousand.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
To do what?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Where do I sign?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Hey, Findley's here.
Sure.
I'll beat him the next game.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
You want me to tell her for you?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Who's he?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
In the gut, I mean.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
Talk to me, Charlie.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Would you like to come out tonight?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Who's he?
How long you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Yours.
Have a nice trip.
Have a nice trip?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm not.
At school. It's Thursday.
I've got something in my bag.
What's this supposed to mean?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Is that what makes a winner?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
What is it, Eddie?
Why should I?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Why?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Yes.
You want me to stay?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Only got one kind.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Are you all right, Dad?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
About what?
No.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
What do you want?
I take it you've heard.
Did it work?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Three years.
They don't know this.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Where are they?
And our troops here?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
You're late.
You're late.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
You scared the hell out of me.
Was his father stationed here?
So, what do you do for a living?
We should leave too.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
The Word of God...
Schneider?
Tapestries?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Where did this come from?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
You came back for the book? Why?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Found it.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
And the chair.
What?
Head for the fireplace!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Dad?
The penitent man is humble before God.
What did you find, Junior?
After you, Junior.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Who?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
You have insulted my son.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
I ride with you, Indy?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
What about the future?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
WILLIE?!
A fulcrum release lever!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Yes.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Who was it?
Al.
Yes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Yeah.
Anyone there?
Now what.
Which way do I go?
Corridor A.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Gone where?
Who is it?
What is it?
What about money?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Try another language.
Touch her.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
No. What will you do.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
On what?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What next!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
What exactly?
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
No!
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Surveillance Cameras?
We'll have to let them go.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Your memory.
Fine. You look fine.
What?
Take the card.
Not you. Them.
Who?
Sue who?
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
What did you say?
What?
Blake?
I'll be right there.
And you.
I waited for you.
It's not apparent.
You are.
Promise you what?
And how'm I doing?
Joe! What happened to you?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
What'd he steal?
What is it?
Who was?
What?
What?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Why did you, then?
I knew it. I told him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
It will be fine. You have another.
What's new?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
When's your deadline?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What about you, you got a crew already?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...
What's going on?
Where should I wash them?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
No, you do not.
Alright?
You eating with us?
Lowell.
What?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Yeah... Thank you.
Should I just take the documents now?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I don't think you really understand --
They do this with impunity!
You mean... since this morning?
No.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
There is -- there is no family.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
You did good, Massey!
What a touching story.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
That's his lawyer.
Objection, your honor!
We rest, Your Honor.
No frown lines.  New watch?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Thanks, buddy.
My God.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
He wants a reconciliation.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Me. Yes.
She didn't love you?
No.
Friends?
I don't have a ring!
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Comfy!
You can't prove anything.
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
It's not something I wanted either.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Who's that?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
What's Kirshner?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Oh—Mary—
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Nothing. 
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Why? Do you know him? 
Oh, no—no.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
Why; naturally, I—
What do they say?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Like what?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
What do you mean—starvation?
To New York?
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter— 
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
What'd you give him for the car?
I hope you got your money.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
But can't you wait until morning—
What time is it?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yes.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Joe, listen—
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
What?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
There's a seat over there for you.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Huh?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You know you keep saying that.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
No, I did not.
You know damn well who it is.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
And Shaw?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Aren't you being a little hard?
A Willie O'Keefe?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
What?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Get a hold of yourself.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
...and your General?
You have other information?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Germany.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Yes.
What are they?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
What's the problem?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Course you didn't.
She sound scared?
She wants to go back to work.
We are. Don't worry about it.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not a loser.
I gave you my card there.
I'd love one, but not there.
What have they told you?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Who is this?
He came by.
How do you feel about getting old?
It's different with men.
Catching a movie.
And Annette's it for you?
What're you, a bag lady?
Will Ordell go for that?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Why?
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
Where're you going?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
I'm just tired in general.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
We can look into that.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
That would be one point of view.
I have no idea.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You think I'm kidding?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
And what was your answer?
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
If you want.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
Who?
What'd you care?
She don't know shit about the money.
Designer clothes.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
I don't like dancing.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Yeah, down the end.
As low as two.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
You know how she is.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Haven't a clue.
Hey, Max.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
You know who this is?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
In a way, yes.
That I gotta see.
It's the next street.
Turn left.
No.
We're back.
Get me out of here.
I'm alive.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Just to see you. That's all.
You have an unusual hand.
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
They're not interested, Jake.
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
It was the window.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What do you mean, demons?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Not me, buddy.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
What?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
It's good to see you.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
But I see them.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
What happened to you?
Jezzie, I can't see.
The best.
What?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
You okay?
Show me Della!
What does it say?
Get your clothes off.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
How come? The army?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
Stay away from me, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Bullshit!
I'm not upset.
Mid-town mostly.
Sit down, Jake.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
You come here often?
Total delirium.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
This is not a dream! This is my life.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Still married, Jake?
Who is?
Everywhere, like a plague.
How did it happen?
Is he all right?
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
What?
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Where have you been?!!
Creepy.
I'll need system four converters.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Where is...?
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Old woman?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
I...I don't know what I did...
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
You must shut down the engines.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Barbie from hell...
You killed him?
I'm sending you the files.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
But...I...400 years?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
What good will that do?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Just a favor for your old man.
Did you bring a check?
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
It's three feet deep, Martin
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Rogue?
What stinks so bad?
What? What?!
...Nothing.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Some friends and me took a house.
We're not even sure what it was.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Over there!
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
So that's cool with you, then?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
No...
Yeah. That was me.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
No.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Can I take your coats?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
Is the baby okay?
Elbow.
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Unfortunately, yes.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
No way! She's pretty.
Keith's hot.
You don't say.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
You lose!
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Where you from Walter?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Brian.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
So tell me... what happened here?
So how's it going?
...and I think I know why.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
...never?
Early, just think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
What happened?
Yes!
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
Probably.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Why I do what?
Where you goin' tonight?
You sure?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
You know what I want to do?
Why?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
What?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
What happened?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
You've heard the stories right?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hello?
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
By yourself?
What's that supposed to mean?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
The door was open.
You got it on the board.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
A few people.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're not going to tell me that.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
What?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Let me speak to my daughter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
No problem.  We're in.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
Anything?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
He's right, Kathy.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Through a rental agency.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Answer the question.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
It is.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead now.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
I know you didn't
Doesn't that scare you?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
You don't understand.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Well, you're beautiful.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Does the Queen live?
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
They know when they're going to die?
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
I have need of friends.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
We must try to get horses.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Would you settle for a boar?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Food for crows.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
He will come for me.
How many did you lose?
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
No, she was not as beautiful.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Why must you know?
What's that man's name?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...What?
Rocket launcher.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
What?
Where are you going?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
You say it just to calm me!
...Yes?
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
He probably just went somewhere.
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you a preacher?
Pardon?
You do?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Yes?
What it is -- is the truth.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I missed you Kris.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
I need your help.
Is it a boy or a girl?
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
Orange soda?
Water?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
OK.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Where have you been staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Harvard Law School?
I have a 4.0.
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
I loved him!
I'll take that as a no.
Is he always such an ass?
It's so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
No!
No.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
What are you talking about?
Is everything okay?
I'm sorry, but --
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Why didn't you call me?
What?
Yes?
I think so...
I don't know.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Relation?
The idiot speaks.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Yes, you are.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Josh proposed!
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
How do you figure?
And you know this for a fact?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Is he the only one?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
What?
I got bangs!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
No.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
There he is!
Fool's magic.
You go?  Not watch fun?
Fire moat... why do that?
God protect me.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Damn you!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Kill me... I want... so nice...
No more... please...
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
I didn't know... I --
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
East of Mercia?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's terrible.
No, wait... please... listen...
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
You be our guest, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Something the matter?
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Easily spoken...
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Can't we move any faster?
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
You see!  You see!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
How're these?
A promise is a sacred oath.
How much longer?
Who?
They tricked you.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
She's dead!
I'd be honored.
And charmed, of course.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Where?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
I couldn't sleep last night.
He must.
He seems lonely.
No.
Alyssa.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
Really?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
I don't wanna go.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens?
A violation?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
What can I do for you, George?
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
I didn't recognize you!
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
I'm not going!
No.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm leaving.
Did you got through my pants?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You're too fucking late.
I'll have to pay him back.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I took some of your Vicodin.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you be doing now?
To hide a black eye.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
After everything.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Because Dad left?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
What?
A blueprint spool.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
I drove over and you were gone.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
What is it?
It's been a while.
Going on?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You bit my finger.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
I can't go right now.
No.
Hey.
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
This is what he wants.
Yes, it is.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
Nigger.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
She's alright, isn't she?
Yes, boss.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
That's because I've never been here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Start your job? What kind of job?
What?
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Winston. His name's Winston.
This fork is filthy.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
What's up, Ray?
No.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
What is that?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Move it out.
So it don't exist.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
What do you think about that?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Apparently, your sister died.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
My mom wasn't a goat?
An angel?
Where did you meet my father?
What is it?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Where is he? He's late.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Release the evil?
You did it for Namath.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I mean... tough break.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
So go get 'em, Dad!
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Please. You got to.
Dude. Seriously?
Adrian?
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Sometimes, sure.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
That just hurt a lot.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you think we came from?
How did they get in here?
What other food?
Had enough?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Where do you live, Mary?
I'm very smart.
And?
What Quad do you live in?
A Runner gave it to me.
I -- I can't.
Are you taking me to them?
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I doubt it.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Is it inside the city?
All this. All of it.
Hello, Sandman.
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No, no, no
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
You're not contagious are you?
Listen.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
What a fuckin' job.
I don't know.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
You liked it.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Are you my man?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Who is this man?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
Yeah?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
It'll be ready.
Okay.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Why, of course. Yes.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Where are they? Do you see them?
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Certainly not.
The police?
They were in a quandary, and—
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
No.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Well - I'm—
And mine's Conway.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
You have no disputes over women?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Why, no.
Now, what would you like to do?
Splendid!
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Yes.
What is it? Has he fainted?
What do you mean if we should get out?
Porters?
What about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Oh, George . . .
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Good.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Thank you.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why, mother?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
It'll make sense later?
Well this didn't.
I'd go with number three.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
So what's the problem?
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
And what's this ... ?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Jesus...
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
You were saying?
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Sure.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
What are you doing?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
How could it not?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This it?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
He's gone, too.
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Forget that guy --
Oh, God...
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
The other two will die without me.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
Found?  Where?
Why?
You don't remember me, do you?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Lara --
Uh-huh...
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Red Ball?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
You're not gonna kill me?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I believe in that system...
It's insanity around here.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
I understand.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Good God.  What was that?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
We can stop him.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
John Anderton was my friend!
What about your meeting?
Since right after we lost our son.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Where's the place to go tonight?
It's on West Broadway.
Manhattan.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
You're not my daddy.
Chloe?
I don't know.
No.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Ho's a good guy --
I never promised you anything.
What's your record at?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
Yeah?
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
That it?
Me? No. Not really.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
No.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Ruiz knows about this?
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
A bad heart.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
Sorry, man, but...
What about boxing?
What about it?
What are you saying?
I will.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
Fuck him.
What? Did she say something?
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
C'mon, man...
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
I told you what they said.
They asked who it was.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You happy?
You too?
Back in.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Let's do it.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Calm down.
Where do you get this shit?
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
What's up, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
You really in trouble?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Ow, shit...
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Nah, man...
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yes, sir.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
I'll get it.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Did you just now con me?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
You never had it.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
What you say?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Don't con me.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Little.
Then the devil is white.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Could we sit down someplace?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Yes. Did you eat?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
We need you too!
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I'm tired of praying.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
I told you we don't know for certain.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
"His greatest greatness."
She know?
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Get out.
You're my father.
You the man.
You had the number.
Fine as May wine.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Who the hell are they?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
You did something on impulse?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Yes or no?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
We're taking a different way home.
And don't start crying.
Did you sleep alright?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
I know you're not.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
I don't believe you.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
What? Who?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Yeah, sure.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
We just talked.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Who?
Ah?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Were the lights on?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
No...
I'll wait for your call.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Are you kidding?
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure. This girl said...
Marty...
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
What nurses?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Don't you use olives?
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
Us. Lead us not into...
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Sixteen times.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
And there it is.
Black capsule.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
For you, Trapper.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
The bastards outconned us.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
But I'm married.
Of course not.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Yes, Reverend?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Sir?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Huh?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Who?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
I guess so. Then what happened?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
What?
Looks all right—
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
He's watching the other door.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Sure.
I want it as soon as possible.
Huh? Get what?
How?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Did you write it—or didn't you?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
How?
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Who are you again?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
Are you in charge, Roper?
Is that all?
It rarely has to be done.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
You living together?
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
I can't do that.
So what do I say to this guy?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
You tell me.
Yes.
You know why I like the track?
They need to run first and second?
The jockey!
We won!
We lost.
How much you wanna bet?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
What the fuck is going on.
And what about the ones you don't save?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Is the hostage injured?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
You like this place?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Prude.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Tell him to give me a raise.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you need?
They have nothing to do with this --
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
What's happening?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Two maze runners.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
You're jumping to conclusions.
One condition.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
That's right.
Insurance.
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
Why?
I wasn't with you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There?
Program name?
Resurrection.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
So how can we get to it?
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
Anybody see anything?
Where did it originate?
Let's go after him!!
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
That was a CHEAP shot!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Boo-Boo.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
It's a mask.
You could have stopped him.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Come off it, Bugs.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I've got friends.
What about the share.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Okay. I'm listening.
Strategy.
Jesus.
Luciano is dead?
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Sure. Why?
What are you watching?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
What's the matter?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I don't want to talk about it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
... Oh ...
Yeah.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
I did not--
Tell me why!
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
"There's more light here," he says--
Waiter!
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Why me?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
No wonder--without your dinner.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Henry Hill.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
I did. What about it?
Jeff for Senator.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I yield.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Yield *how*, sir?
Please, sir!--come with me!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Certainly would, Joseph.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
What is it?
The man downstairs said number--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Oh, just a day--
Some committee's got it.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
*This* is.
On paper?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
A camp! Well!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Go away, Nosey.
You want to see me, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
They think he's pixilated.
No, no children.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Are these the articles?
But they did take place?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
It's wonderful.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, here we are again.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Can I have a month's vacation?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Sure.
What's bothering you, huh?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Boy, was he burning.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Nuisance value?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
What for?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Uh-huh.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
I'm Chairman?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Your Honor—
Yes?
Who are they?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
What is your name?
Where is your farm?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You came home last night - without them.
Please!
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Me more than most.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Uh-huh. What are they?
What's that?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
I've had my moments.
A little.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
My patient had to leave early.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
What do you want to know?
Oh, I don't know...
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Okay.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
What's wrong with her?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you do.
Could I see Sofie, please?
What?
Hmm.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Sorry... I'm done.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Yes.
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Yeah?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I think so.
Hello.
What?
Anything... just ask.
Where was this?
What are you talking about?
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
This is exactly what I wanted.
She's probably ten years older than you.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Skip.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
A doll?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And how does one do that?
Now go find me a big stick.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What does he want the book for?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
You bastards!
And what did he say?
Two hundred pounds.
You lie.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Fifty percent.
So who's the broad?
I just decked your brother
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
The things that get you excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
How?
Something like that.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I'm not?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
It's everybody's problem!
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
None taken.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Do I?
But you're a superhero.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
What did he mean?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Are you an actress?
Really?
I saw him walk you home.
Date?
I just want to be a superhero.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Cover me!
So you're chicken?
Roy --
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Hi.
Or Batman --
And a social life.
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Through there!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I'm not insulted.
And where is the army?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
That is incredible.
Who is there?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
What's your name?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
I know of no better time.
May I offer you a drink?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were they pretty?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Why you say that?
Who are you?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Who is that?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
This you?
Man, this a cool house.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
You walked?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I don't play for no team.
What it smell like?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
What?!  What that mean?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Just do it.
William.
What?
Huh?
Hey, what's going on?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
What's the matter?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
I need your help.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
For what?
The gun...
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
But...
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I promise.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Who?
Yeah, all right, listen...
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do!?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
Everybody does?
You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Yeah.
Where?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Where's your Mom?
Here they come.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
Where's Ruby?
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
How do you mean?
Who?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Twenty-five wives!
Tricked us!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
To see Dad?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Up river.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right...  Come along.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Yes; John's bad.
Can I have milk too?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Where's she at?
I been bad!
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
It's just a stupid cat.
No.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Sure, but...
Did you sleep?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
No.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
You feel better now, right?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
About what?
A dress you wear in the evening.
And there?
You feel it, though.
What is it, Anna?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Or it might be the firing squad!
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
What is it?
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
Your Highness...
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Leon, my little boy.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Yes, monsieur.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
If there is anything we can do for you...
Yes. It is unfortunate.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
No visa.
You, please.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
So that is your house?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
What do we do now?
Thank you.
You know I want to...
Room service speaking.
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
At what?
On which boat?
I have never heard one.
It's nine o'clock.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Go on.
You must, darling.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Would that make you any happier?
Radio! What is radio?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Did you win?
Make it ice cold.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
What is this, Swana?
Has done what?
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
Good morning.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Madame, if you...
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask what has happened?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
This will do. 
Where to, madame?
Where is it?
Your Highness.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Where the hell is he?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Yeah?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
What about England?
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Who?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
What?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Ummm...
We took his system out.
Kissinger?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Why?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Elvis I like, too.
Sir?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
I'll do it.  No more.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Buddy? ...
I don't want them to love me.
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Tomorrow.
Don't be ridiculous!
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Didn't know there was any.
How fresh is this coffee?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
No I ain't.
Who's he in trouble with then?
He won't neither. He never has.
Well I didn't see it.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
Big talk.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Uh-huh.
What makes you say that?
I know where it's going to be.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
I don't need to talk to you.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
How much?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Yessir.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
...Where you want me to put it?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
What room?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yes?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Cast iron?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Could I have that in American?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
...plenty
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You must be joking.
Who are these idiots?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I better go check on them.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
No... what about your sister?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
So, call me when you --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Where you headed, Betty?
Did you love it?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
No. Loma Vista.
You made out alright.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Guess who I saw today.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
No, almost never.
Rosa...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
...this is your sweater, right?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
What do you mean?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
It's not here. Let's go.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Like... us?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
No.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
We know that...
What the hell's going on?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Uh-huh.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
What do we do now, Everett?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Uh, we uh-
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
'N turned into a frog -
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
In any state.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Not out the other side his face, though.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Not your...
Well, I'm sorry honey -
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
That don't make no sense!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
Pete... I do apologize.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
It was a powerful air.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
I been calling for four months.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Zack, we've got to go.
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
What?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
God help you, Lynette!
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
That was great.
I don't want you to move.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
You told us it would grow out an inch.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
You okay?
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
The fuck did you do that for?!
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Fuck.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Be quiet.
Hey.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Everything okay?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Suit yourself.
Well, I know that now.
What do they want?
Say fuck.
What am I, a five year old?
What are you doing?
Huh uh.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
I don't think that will be any problem...
And did you witness the shoot-out?
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah.
Yeah... let me think about it.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
If you got something to say, say it.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
What are you saying?
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
And the Governor?
Oh?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Cheraw Falls.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
You know what happened.
And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Go on.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
And your principles?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
But what about Thomas?
Seventeen.
But father, they might come this way.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
It's gorgeous!
Please hurry.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Is he really all right?
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
Ellie? What's wrong?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I'm not tired!
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Hey--they actually found the place!
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Does she love the cat?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Rachel not feeling well?
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I heard you tonight.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
The situation has changed.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Then why aren't you eating?
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I can't breathe.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Ceremony?
I know the code.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Say again?
A fool's errand.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Dead serious.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You cheated.
Move away.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Why are brothering with that?
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Wheelchair accessible.
You can't mean that.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Do you think she loves him?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
It will be an ascension.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Where did he go?
You don't want this.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Aaabout...?
What are you going to do?
Of course, sir.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Same old Daniel.
Is that so?
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
... just like the mouse.
Mouse?  What mouse?
We don't have time for hysterics.
Why do we need it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
What did you want my hair for?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
You saved my life.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
And you have him?
Vermin...
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
I think I better go, Stew.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am Stewart.
No? What do you look upon her as?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Ah-ah-ah!
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
All right, all right, don't mention it.
How's that?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Araby?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
I dyed one and washed the other.
My mistake - she's glaring.
How far have you gotten?
Been where?
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
I have it here.
I think you'd better go.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I don't eat waffles.
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Did you call, sir?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
What do you mean?
What?
It doesn't matter.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
It's okay. It's alright.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Thanks ... I love you.
I'm sorry ...
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Bud.
The other one?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
God, David. Just give it to me!
What happened?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
What do you mean?
Well if I don't who will?
What's wrong?
Sure.
Yeah ...
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Yes.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Mmmmgh.
Where are they?
Yeah ... Sort of ...
What department store did they go to?
McGinty's.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
BUD.
I had nothing to do with that.
Look ...
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Really?
Hi.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
It's beautiful.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Free?
Hey.
Cool.
So you can't talk to me?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
Somewhere in Utah.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm trying to be your friend.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Are you gonna do it?
What?
I....please don't do this.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Sure.
...yes...
...yeah....well you have me now.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hello?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yeah.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
I don't have a girlfriend --
Why did you tell me you did, then?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Not very well.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Yeah, not really.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Yeah?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
This is Barry.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
That was good.
Ok.
Where you married?
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
It's ok to ask that.
I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
......and this is confidential?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Who is this?
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Yes I'm fine.
You should go on a trip.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Hi.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes. Sorry.
What are you doing?
Seven o'clock.
Seriously.
I know.
I know.
I don't really remember that.
Ok.
So they'll go.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
What did you say?
Are you ready?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
It's not even noon --
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
A man after my own heart...
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Coulmier, you animal!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
An innocent child is dead.
AND DID YOU?
Well...?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Yes?
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Here it is; the last chapter.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
There's something else I want from you.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Go on, child.
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
I am eternally in your debt.
Of course.
Good God, Marquise --
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Doesn't that please you?
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Sure
My name is Orson Welles
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
I can't remember the lines!
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
I wanna see the picture today
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
So speaks the court jester.
It doesn't have to be
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I'll hire you  -- right now-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
It's too late. The movie's made
Mank!
Herman.
It came.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Yes
Get out
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
We done?
Yes!
He's Christ?
About what?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It's not done.
You're a good sport, lady.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Yeah --
Go 'head.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
See? That's all there was to it.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
But you said "you."
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Whatsa matter with you?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Yeah. At night.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Who asked you?
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Where you been all day?
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
I'm leaving you Jake.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
The kids are sleeping.
What are you doing?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
For instance?
She never left the apartment --
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
A detective's nightmare.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Ever get an answer?
That depends on who "they" were.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Your Lisa?
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Hello.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Lisa Fremont.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
She's just not the girl for me.
Isn't he a salesman?
You called the police?
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Would four of them -- ?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
You haven't even heard from him?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Big enough?
Tired?
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
What is it you're looking for?
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I do?
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Nobody chickened.
You know something?
You thought I was Mom?
You awake?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
He's just loaded, honey.
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Hi.
Boy!
You shouldn't monkey with him.
He has a knife.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Hey where'd you go?
Here.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
My gun?
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
'Bye, Mom.
What's that got to do with it?
Do I have to spell it out?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
If he could--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Why did you do that?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
What?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
I'll never get close to anybody.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
We were romantic then too--
No.  Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Gabriel!
Is this him!?
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I don't think it's negative five.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Where the hell are you going?
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
You're in on this.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
What?
Nick, what happened --
You saved me.
Don't say my name...
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said it a million times!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I had better sex in prison.
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
They won't recognize me.
Might as well be.
Do I get a country-western name?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe?
How do we take them out?
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Oh.
GUARD!!!
NO!!!
How'd you know I'd do it.
Do what?
That's what it looks like!
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Elois?
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
...What bar?
Didja use the commode story?
What?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Mr. Blue's dead?
You gonna put it away?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
What's she doin' now?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
As opposed to good?
Uh-uh, just cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Tell them to come on in.
And one of 'em is sick.
You can't leave us here.
And this is Helen Carter.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All right -- it's said!
I can't --
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Finished, son?
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
You know what she asked me?
What did you come back for?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
All right, you didn't know.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Stop it -- stop it.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Go on. Have another try at him.
How do you know who we are?
We got to get movin'.
I sure would.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Alex, what are you doing?
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
It looks like the furnace.
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Oh.
Are you okay?
It's okay.
How about these buns?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
It was you...
Both of them?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father!
Uh, uh.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Professor!
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
What the hell?!
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
I can do it myself.
What are you working on?
You do.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
My help?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, are you okay?
What?
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Carl's a jerk!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP!!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
It's not fair!!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's him!
You got your wish.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I don't like this.
You scared?
She could use a hundred dollars.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Hello, Frances.
Nothing.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I don't know.
Let her know what?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I can imagine.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
What was she to you?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
She's not been here for a long time.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Well...
You play an instrument?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I feel like they do.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Hi!
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
You went out with her?
Can we look at one?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
Everything about sex.
And they just answer them?
I'm sorry this came up.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes.
Yes.
Why not?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
I'm not in love with you.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Possibly.
Don't do that.
Come on!!
Loud.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
You son of a bitch!!
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Is he still at your house?
What brought this on?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Why?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Let me talk to him first.
Yes, I did.
I wanted him to see me.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
What is it?
You want me to leave?
And you ask questions, right?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Then what happened?
Is that what he tells you?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
You told Ann about this?
Why not?
No.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Who?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Plenty of room for two people.
Plus first and last month deposit.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Mr. Millaney?
Hi. Want a drink?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
You're the one who found the bodies?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
We live in 703.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
You got it!
You got it!
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
McKinley?...McKinley?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
Could you tell us a little about it?
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Why?
Brad!
F for...
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Isn't she lovely?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Stephanie.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
I'd rather have a knife.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
That's what you do with every one.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
We should have driven.
And she likes Pinot.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
So what's the plan today?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Nice, huh?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
What do you think?
We're on.
So what should I wear?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
You should call her.
Where is Stephanie?
Nice shot.
With Maya.
Slaughterhouse.
We're on.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
What?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Please, Miles, please.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
You got kids?
Yeah. Thanks.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Where are you?
Ken.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
About four weeks.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
This one?
My ballet recital.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
No I'm not.
Yes.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What are you doing?
Merrill --
It's getting stronger.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
The footprints.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I don't think so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is that him?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
That's why they got you in jail?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
Where's Jake?
Gotta go.
Paden sends his best.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
You must have known that before you came.
You're not Baxter?
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Where's the pinto going?
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You might make a farmer yet.
You own this land.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Never will again.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
What are you talking about?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Because they enjoy it.
He must be pretty good.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
You've got a legitimate job.
I just got to town.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
You're not renewing my contract.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Why isn't she with you?
I'll send you her resume.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Everyone you know is lying.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
... Simone.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Not if I don't let her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Why not?
Is she here?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
She still with Kent?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I know.  Thank her for me.
About you and mom?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know what you're up to.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Taller, Viktor.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Thank you.
But that's Simone's part.
A star is...
You mean they buy it?
I am the death of real.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
What were they hiding from?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
I wish I were somewhere else.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
Really?
Where is she?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Someone actually... employs you?
Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Suzie???
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You'll be back.
Throw me one.
What's wrong?
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
How does it feel, Keith?
Then why go back now?
What about Jeremiah?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
No Mac, please... I --
I almost thought for a second...
Like what?
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sorry.
It's my nature.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Sorry.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
What?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Who'd want to?
But you could get killed, right?
I give up.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!
Yeah?
My very words.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
What can I say?
Yes.
But you'll do it?
I'll do it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Do I have a choice?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
We're outta motion lotion.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
What about the sheriff's task force?
No.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Damn... alright then.
Are you on a land line?
I left him a message.
Okay.
Here. Sit.   Please.
My debrief --
...So you made another deal?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah... Sid?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
You love her?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
What'd you say?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
That's fantastic.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
And professionally?
My wife.
Rheya.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Probably.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
I love her.
Jesus...
What are they?
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
What happened?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Who have you been talking to?
But we fought.
Why did she do it?
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I can't --
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
What did he say?
You all right?
Sooner, the better.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
How did you know?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
You asked.
You could do better.
What do you want to do?
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Pretty bad.
Everyone's all right...?
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you watch?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
You in this with me?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Remember Little League?
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
What are you doing this weekend?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Do you mind if I come too?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
I'll introduce you.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
I will finish what I've begun…
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
No…
You're sure you're all right.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Is you all good Nazis?
Is you all little Adolfs?
What's the match gag?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What's the award?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You'll fix me up!
What do those broads say?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
What are you going to do?
What radio?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Says who?
Says me.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
What?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Do you remember him?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
These are my children...my children.
Why would you want to leave?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
No, no. Thank you.
Antonia?
That's right.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
Keep her together until I get back.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
It looks like we're too late.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
David, I don't understand...
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
.          .. Spock's tube...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Captain, what's happening?!
Good shooting, Scotty.
What happened...?
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
The ship... Out of danger...?
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
No, sir, no response.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Genesis, I want it.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
What you ask is difficult.
What I have done, I had to do.
So!  Speak!
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
They even killed the galley chief.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Maybe...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
I don't mean to intrude.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Departing dark side, Regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
She's not responding...
And who is this?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
... the good of the few...
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Admiral?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Admiral on the bridge --
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
You lied.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Damage report!
Find it?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
We don't want to be any trouble.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Thanks. Cheers.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
But Kirk...
... Gone?!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
Permission to come aboard.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
What are the variables...?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Three-one-zero, aye!
I have no control, sir!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Any luck...?
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
How long, Scotty?
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Hi.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Jak'tahla?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
No one's ever asked me that before.
Are they in any danger?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
... had regenerated.
Full impulse.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Sir?
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
What you're doing to my neck...
Come in.  Hi.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You actually performed surgery...?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
No... the door's too thick.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Some.
Why?
Life signs?
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Captain?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Figures.
Are we playing multiple choice?
What?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
Yes.
For insubordination.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Just the size of my head -
They're preparing to fire.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aft thrusters -
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Sir?
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
What is it?
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Direct hit -
That could take hours!
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Why?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Sir?
Deanna, on my mark.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

With or without the rest of the fleet?

What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
No!
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's not quite the face you remember.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
You're not Reman.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Yes.
Intruder alert!
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Find her again.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
I'll have to run your card off now.
Make any money?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Thank you.
Where's that?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
You're not hearing me.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Steering wheel...
Gear shift.
Eh... police.
What?
Pancakes.
Money.
Shit.
I...
What?
Sun...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
No... The closest...
Why?
Why?
But I must go here.
What is hitchhike?
Say it.
The driver will...
I do not speak English.
The car will stop?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
You liked my singing?
Are you angry at me?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Where are you going?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What?
Horses.
Do they talk?!
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Yes.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Well...
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
I will.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
No, sir. Radar.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
I wouldn't think so.
Hello...
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Bullshit politics.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Leave him alone, Tran.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Forget it's there.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
No.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Sleaze to peddle.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Are we under arrest?
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Besides that.
Testa?
No.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Dylan here.
You heard?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
A grill pattern.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You... surprised me.
What are you...?
Not bad, huh?
What did he look like?
What about his killer?
He said it was a clue?
I think I talked to him.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
There was talk of a file photo.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Miss me, Dave?
You are so fucked up.
How long have you been downtown?
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Don't be too harsh.
It's a no-no.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
What's that?
What's up?
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
You okay?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
No weapon.
Agent Mackelway?
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
He's moved on to TV.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Let's talk about Zero.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
350 miles.
Shit.
You've been through worse.
You should call your Grandmother.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I'm Mike.
I like quiche.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Anything?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
You haven't told then, huh?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
The poor thing. Six years?
Could you believe it?
On the table.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...the Michelin commercial...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
I didn't want to say anything.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
An eight.
Oh.  Where is this place?
Kinda money, huh?
Bud.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, you're doing so well...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
You miss the pain?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Not well.
You live in such a fantasy world...
What are they doing here?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
That's right.
Hello?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
VEGAS.
Tonight, baby.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas.
That's not cool.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Mikey's the big winner.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...Baby...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That was different.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
How long do I wait to call?
It's not like that...
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
You think?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...You're just poking at it...
...honestly...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
The bear's got his claws back.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
And with prison record.
When did he call?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
For bravery.
And this?
Then why have I become a man like you?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
I know.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Mike!  The party starting!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Sure.
What will your father say?
I'm thinking about it.
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Go on Mike.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Just be patient.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Thanks.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
Is he alive?
Is that good?
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
It's just an undercoat. 
This is so good of you.
What?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
He's downstairs.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
How?
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Hello?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Such as?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Ha. Did he say why?
Marge, when did you get here?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
What's your secret?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Which is?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I know.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
My God.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
A few days ago.
31 people.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
I don't know...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
That's really something.
You know what you remind me of?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
But this is a porno movie.
Where are you going?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
No, why?
What taxi driver?
Try holding the match like this.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
No, why?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Stick up?
Where.
I have.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
I don't remember.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I musta been stoned.
Where?
God, you are square.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You just gonna leave 'em?
How?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
There's porno theatres for that.
Some. Here and there.
You moonlightin?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
O.K., cowboy.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
Stick with Carla.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Surprise, surprise.
You knew?  All this time?
Hi.
What about you, Delly?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Did you bring along something to read?
Dad?
Well...
City hall?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Whoa.
What?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
When did you start smoking?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Start with what you knew then.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Are you saying that he's...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
But I...
Yes.
Did I what?
What.
Sandra Sinclair.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Aren't you coming?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Cigarette?
What do you mean?
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
Found me.
Cat.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I already have.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
It's a lovely garden.
Yes.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I see.
Do you think I should go?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes, I did.
No!
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Try my best.
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
Gulls!
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes, very.
In a bird shop.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Where will we go?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I started to say... inside...
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I don't mind, really.
Did you close the door?
Not by the thousands.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
How can you tell?
I don't know you.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Criminal.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
You are, aren't you?
Oh. That. Rome.
Yes.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
It's an uprising.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Take wing!
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I think it's safe to get out now.
The town looks clear.
When will they stop?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
That... that... who was that?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Scotch, light on the water.
Birds?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
No.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Not yet.
I want it --
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I've drunk enough tonight.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
Was the paralysis immediate?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
Where are they?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
You're wrong.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Where the fuck did you come from?
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Yeah, no kidding.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
Are you ok?
Yeah, we do.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Anything wrong?
What is it?
You're in with them.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Where is that?
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think they'll ever find him?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
No foolin'? Will you?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Thank you... Have you any news?
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Naturally I think so.
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
How do you like Santa Carla?
All day.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Yeah.
All together?
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Death to all vampires!
Don't!  Stop!
Where is she?!
Look.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
... And stay outta here.
Good!
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It was a dream, Star.
No.  Just you.
I'll hitch.
Okay?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Lucy.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
I am?
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
What would that make Mom?
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What about Mom?
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Who are you calling?
What do you want from us?
That night?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
What?
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Cut him loose?
What's happening?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What?
What for?
Would that test have worked?
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
Hey, man...!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
He's dead.
Why?
He might just wait us out.
What is it?
What about Childs?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
What else can they do?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
What kind of stories?
No...
But you're only a mud carrier.
1899.
Excuse me?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes.
The air... the power.
No...
This has to end.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I'll never forget this.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
What?
Why would you let me go back?
You took her because she helped me.
A man can change his history.
It's spectacular...
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
Why is it -- breaking up?
Dance with me...
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Admiration?  My my.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Alex, what is it?
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
In the future, we'll be better.
For God's Sake, David --
Hiding?
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
What is it?
I can't do that --
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Yes.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You can see so many here.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes.
The mud carriers.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Yes.
Mara --
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
What do you mean?!
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
No, you're safe --
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
What about Starks?
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
You sure you know where to find one?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I need to get this letter to someone.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I gave you my dog tags.
But no one knew until after...
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Why?
Me, too.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
William, you're not making sense.
No, he didn't.
Where are we going?
I've been ok.
Why, what would you do?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
What do you mean?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
What about the world?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You told me this was how it happened.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Who told you this?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Well, where are you from?
I'll manage.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
What's this?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Hon.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Alright.
That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.
Armed robber.
A .38.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
You're a bank robber?
How?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Hello...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Maybe.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Holy shit.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Yeah.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Whaddo we do?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
This is so beautiful.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Thelma!
Ready?
Yeah, you want it?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
What?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Hi!
Gay? He said you were gay?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Mary's a babe!
I am?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
I work with retards.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
She's blackmailing you, right?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
So you found Mary?
No, not at all.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
What are you doing?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
You bet.
You know, I really should take your card.
Ho-ly shit.
Thanks for picking me up.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I can live with those reflections.
No I'm not.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Where's Puffy?
Pat's an architect, too.
You don't think they're too big?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Can I pour you one?
Ted, are you okay?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Well... why don't you move back?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Please leave.
Really?
Shhhhhh!
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Yes, sir.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
The other thing is...
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Yeah.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Forget it, Scotty.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Let's get out of here.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
How'd you know?
Who is he?
Let's see it.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Jesus, you alright?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Still after Jimmy?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
What's that?
1868...
This Jimmy's?
Come back?
What are you doing on the reservation?
No way. No fuckin' way.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
That's a big comfort to me.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Used to what?
I'm different.
Make what?
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
Anything.
Just good luck.
This is it, then.
Where are we?
What do you do when you come here?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Sir?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
No! Not again!
Is there something I should know?
The plane is fine.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Why do you all have such funny names?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Did what?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
I've lost him -- where is he?
It's a victory roll.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
How do you feel?
Would you take me back? Would they?
Need a ride?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Get it, please.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Stop fighting and get out.
What is it?
Where?
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
You tell me.
Oh, Rekall.
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Nobody.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
I'm not interested in that.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
You sure about this?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
You can't fight'em that way...
What the hell you doing back already?
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
What the hell are you doing?!!
Well, what's wrong with it?
Darn it!
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
I brought it... to the coroner.
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
He was your snitch.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
We had a description of the suspect.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Chinatown street gang.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
-- Easy as that, huh?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I don't need sleep!
Figures.
I killed the motherfucker.
Y-yes, sir.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I followed you here from court.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Soldado.
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Blonde.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What was?
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Is there a golf course around here?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Where are the Cookies?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
I can't help you there.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Laura, do you love me?
It does matter. We're in love.
See what?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
You're getting warmer.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Bobby didn't give you this?
I don't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
You would not...?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I am seventy-four years old.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
I completely understand...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
That's what I'd planned to...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
...and you're going to do that?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
Thank you...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes...
One hour.
Why is that?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Ready, your Honor.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I'm a lawyer.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Isn't there something you...
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No.
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
I want to buy you a drink.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
...he's a good man...
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
...four years ago...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Nothing there now.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They are living creatures out there.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
The nightmares.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He's had some sort of...episode.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
no.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
You okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
What...happened?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Holy...
The car's no there yet?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Then what is he doing?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
Your father?
You sound so sure.
Why did we begin this?
I haven't forgotten.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Congratulations.
What?
Hey, shut up will ya?
What's the difference?
Can we talk?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Passport?
Fine.
Forget it.
That's how he died you know.
I can't go in there.
Yes sir.
Uh, huh.
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Of what?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
But you invited is aboard.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Who is it Philip?
And being sixteen.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
What do you think?
We've got a problem.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Phil.  What are you doing?
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
I can't be sure.
I understand.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Get out.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
You an indian?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
She really say she was pregnant?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Used to.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
That is my permiso.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
...Asshole.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
What is it, Johnnie?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
You won't of missed much.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
You're perfect for me, too.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
That don't seem fair.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
What's that?
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
More'n likely.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Oh shit...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
What's that?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Sailor?
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was in Vietnam.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Six.
Got any plans?
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Yes... Get rid of him.
You need to explain it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Where? In the leg?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No... But...
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
I know... I remember.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
I just mean...
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Which is?
What's to tell?
So what's the problem?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
...we find the jacket.
He was never able to reproduce them.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Is that in my chart?
She told you about...
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Well...
Is that really it?
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Yea, James.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Want me to get that?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Humboldt County?
Maybe...
Glaucoma?
Carvel.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Yes, Hannah?
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
But where? I need the street.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
You got me.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I'm through improvising.
Did you tell Walter?
The more the merrier.
Why yes. How did you know?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Do you get high, Sam?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
The perpetrator.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
It was a beautiful present.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
No thanks.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
I'm not a monster.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's hard to describe.
That was terrific.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
No.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
What's with the boxes?
I count my blessings.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Yes?
It's getting dark. Go home.
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Ev-i-dence.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
You think reflection is good.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
I want to be normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
I don't know.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
I don't know.
Close your eyes.
I'm relaxed.
No, I am not going to --
I was six years old!
You never spoke to me before.
K through sixth.
So?
Do you?
I suffer from insomnia.
How young?
I never hurt them. Never.
Hey, I'm not --
I was always the one seduced.
Nothing. It's over.
I've got problems.
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
What's your fucking problem?
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
She-hit.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You wanna know what I think?
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
What do you think he saw?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
How?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Did you find Wilhite?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Uh, oh...
4800 feet.  It's official.
Would we see the flash?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
And how long will you be away?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Nothing... nothing at all!
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
No, Sandro... Please...
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I'm too sleepy.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
You say that just to flatter me.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Who are you talking to?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
And do you remember where she got off?
Are you the owner of this place?
But where did you come from?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
One of the other Sisters?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I don't know... I don't know...
No I'm not.
Anything... may I sit down?
Have you ever loved anyone?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I've stopped menstruating
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I don't know.
You'll laugh.
Is that what she said?
I'm not sick.
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
She can.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
And then...
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Doctor Livingston.
No.
Why were you afraid?
Why?
And then what happened?
Hm hmm.
Sister Marguerite I think.
A wastepaper basket.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
It was alive wasn't it?
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
???
Eve, she strangled a baby!
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
Who told you this?
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
I can beat that.
Who was the father?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I believe Agnes is different.
What?
It's my affair too.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Was the child full term?
About what?
Like keeping her home from school?
And my permission?
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
You just said...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Yes I do.
Become?  One is born a saint.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
But how did it happen?
This is permission to take her apart.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Before or after you killed the child?
Lay them down.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah?
Shurrup!
Sure.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Why selfish?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Books are good!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Eh?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Ah, go on, you swine.
I'll brook no denial!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
No, not me.
Is it?
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Where's my grandfather?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Where the hell are we?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
This is Chaz.
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Are you okay in there?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Yes?  What is it?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Hey, guess what?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Where did it come from?
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Still unconscious?
What?  What was that?
That must have been when he got it.
What's wrong?
Oh God, oh God no.
Yes, thank heaven.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
I thought I'd find you here.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
They're on the next level up.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
We do know that.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's hear it.
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Better?
Is it dead?
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Thanks.
Minh...
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
But I'm going first...
Still got him?
Okay.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
What's the problem?
Compensate!
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Agreed.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
I... I can't!
And what is your name?
I call myself Phoebe.
You're more than modest.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie...
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Just like that.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
We have that in common.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Eve! My understudy...
Nothing?
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I love you...
Happy little housewife...
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Nothing, really...
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
I'll say.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Margo, let's make peace.
I don't have to. I want to.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Everything.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
- and for you.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Why not?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Don't be dense. The party.
What are you doing here?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
If I only knew how...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Mrs. Richards.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I don't intend to be.
Oh, but there is-
How'd hear about it?
There are other plays...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
They're your fans, your audience-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Roughly ten minutes.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
I remember.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
What time is it?
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
I'm beginning to catch up.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Who is it? What's it all about?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Miss Caswell?  What?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hey?
--what do you think?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
July of '71.
That was fun.  What now?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Why didn't we get that?
Anything you've got.
Republican?
--Haldeman I know, who else?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
What's the matter?
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
Hmm?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Chapin did contact you then?
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Where are your bills, Carl?
Hey... very tense.
Give me your checkbook then.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
Which people?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--I'm not your source on that--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
Just tell me his title.
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
Look, I told you inside--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Yes, sir.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Haldeman too?
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Your name, please.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Where in government?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Haldeman.  Right?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
The what to what?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
All right, I got some scotch.
This is your plan, Finch?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I'm glad you think so.
What?!
What?  No I'm not.
Because I want to.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
What's that?
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
No.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Are you kidding?  No.
I don't get it, that really works?
You think she was serious?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Did I miss anything?!
Holy shit.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yes dad.
Yes.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You can do that?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yes.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Yeah.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Merde! Just missed!
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Like an underground club?
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
No wonder he let her go.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Claude.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
What did she say?
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Here.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Why were you so late tonight
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
What happened to your parents?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
It's the best fork of all
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Why does everyone have to act that way?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
It's her.
He's her?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Hey, you on television?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
What do you mean, next?
It's okay.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yes.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Allison.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
How can you possibly oversleep?
That movie makes me feel guilty.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Well, where is it? I-
For yuh.
All right.
Oh, you do?
Well... thank you again.
Sylvia Plath.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Fifteen years, huh?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Gimme a kiss.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
As Balzac said...
big subject with me, yeah.
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look at these guys.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
What's- It's me, open up.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Oh. What?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
What thing?
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
God.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, I'm sorry!
Oh, you got a headache!
Oswald and ghosts.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Hey.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Whatta you mean?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
She was stealing.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh.
Yeah.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
To dander.  Otis.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
I'll change back before we leave.
So where is young Jonah?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Would you leave us alone right now?
I never put myself in harm's way.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
But she's alright.
She left a note.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
No.  I missed that.
Two minutes.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
It's not like this all the time.
And how hard it hit?
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
It's a novel.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
You're an interior decorator, right?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
That's a lot of those.
Yes.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
You're not serious.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I...
Is there space here?
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Okay.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
Panes?
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
Ah.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
How should <u>I know</u>?
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Well I guess that makes us even.
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Why?
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
You mean tonight?
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I think so.
What is it?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I don't understand --
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Something wrong with your legs?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
You really think so?
What for?
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I see you bought some napkins.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
You usually eat alone?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
I'm fine all over.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
I don't know.
The Vice Squad?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
I am?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Don't mind what?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
How many pills were in that bottle?
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
The party's over.
Kubelik.
Dreyfuss.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know I liked it better long.
How long has it been -- a month?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
We talked about a lot of things.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I have that date -- remember?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Stop that, Fran.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Where do you live?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Where are you headed?
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Esprit de corps --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
I was an FO for the 25th.
We do.
So what happened ?
Chef.
Why they call you that?
Probably is.
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
Can I go get those mangos now?
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Who knows what's up there?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Signs?
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
A lame ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
What's your name, sailor ?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
What?
The wind --
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Boss left.
Wh -- what?
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
No -- no, sir.
Do you know me?
And you admired him?
This one , Lance?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You think he'd of shot us?
What?
Captain Willard?
What will you do after the war?
What things?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Right now -- I am.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
30   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
165  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Thanks.
I'll go into town with you.
Was there any trouble?
It's exactly what you meant.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
That's right.  You're not.
Told you I'm fine!
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
Sure.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
It's Sam Wilder!
Huh?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Go ahead.
No.
So what are you doing with a dog?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What's this?
So. Anything else?
Thank you.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
What's that got to do with it?
Hello?
Nonsense!
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Sex with Simon?
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Hello.
That seems like a good choice.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
I had to see you...
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Good night.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
What the heck are those for?
No. No. Get Carol.
You changed the room around...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Terrify me?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Now we'll both call him.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
What?
What restaurant?
No shit.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
So what happens now?
What does that fucking mean?
Oh, yeah.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Deadline?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
How?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Did it ever bother James Bond?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Thinking.
Why not?
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
We split the money?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I told you, he will.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
How do you know they're not?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Did he explain how this happened?
Because, I'll take it.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
She was taken.
No.
I thought it was interesting --
Why are you working today?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you believe that?
Sure.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
It's possible.
Taken.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Why didn't you fade?
You wish to close this account today?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And put it on expenses?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
No, why?
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Can you do the lock on it?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Destroy the evidence huh.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Perfect!
What happened to Katka?
It just happened.
She's cool.
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
WE gotta think of something.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Some deal you did there!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What are you talking about?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Good morning.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
I've been around.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
What?
I don't want to get in trouble.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
No, I love you, really.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
Shall I wash these out?
Run into Josh?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Yes, if you can get him free.
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
Your father dropped off an extra check.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
You.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
It's private.
I know. Don't say anything.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
The dirty snowball at its core.
The play's going to be really good.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
Maybe you inspire me.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Like fire.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
I don't understand...
Come on.
How do you know this place?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Anything you want.
That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Materially or spiritually?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Scalene?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Why?
You have a name?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Operator, what's today's date?
The power converter...
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Where did you get this?
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Dick? Dick who?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What did you do to your hair?
Gone?... Where?
Yeah, I guess.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
You lost that one?
We did it, Ray.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
You love him?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
My stomach's growling.
You know what I think?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Don't call me stupid.
How you doing?
Is he upset?
Yes.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
You smoke Pall Mall?
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Just gimme a chance.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Got a casualty list?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
He offered you money?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
John Whorfin will kill us!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
I see.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Hello, Barton.
You wrote his scripts for him?
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
I write.
What DID you mean?
Ever act?
...Huh? No, I'm –
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Howdy, neighbor.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Hi, Charlie.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Are you sure –
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
It's more than I've got.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Congratulations.
Big fuckin' deal.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Excellent picture.
All night?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Did you find out about her parents?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
What did she tell me, Beth?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
How did you feel when he died?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
What did you think?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
What did he say?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Are you kidding me?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ten bucks apiece.
That's good. At least they're interested.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Piss painting?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
They're just words.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Out?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who am I?
SAMO.
You got a date already?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
You gonna carry that around all night?
I don't really have any problems.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
Do you know what he's saying?
It's Monday morning.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
What's wrong with me?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
You don't have any!!!
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Uh-oh!
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
It's cold.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Hanging on every word.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
You're not the Mayor.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
You buy this "blurry" business?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
That, sir, does not compute.
Specify, please.
Alfred, are you...?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
What exactly are you doing?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
No beauty...
She knows who we are.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
How are you feeling, young man?
...Afraid.
...A bat.
How about, MR. E.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Just ones this beautiful.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't-.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Chase?
Edward...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
A hit.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
How much do you weigh?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
Oh, Bruce...
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Jesus.
Liar.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
0 my god.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Right first time.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Ahm.....
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
She's ... well, she's good.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Everything okay, David?
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
What's your problem Beavis?
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Uh, ten uh...
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Anything happen while I was away?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
What's she doing here?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
That little girl saw us.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
So can I?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
We tried.
About what?
What about Betelgeuse?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Any particular kind?
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Yes. I think so, too.
... Straight out?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
... Were you going somewhere?
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes, sir.
A Black man gave me the message.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
What is that?
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes. I like to watch.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
I feel very good in here.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Yes. I would like to do that.
I can't read.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes. Of men and women.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
Yes.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
No.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
And look who you brought with!
... How are the kids getting along?
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
This is not what I requested.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Well, Ben... I...
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Oh yeah, he's good.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
What's that?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
A better friend.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Yex?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Yes, well...
I'm right?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
You're late.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
But I think I have another plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
How do we do that?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
No.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
What you want'em for?
Be here. In case.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Extra?
Back stiff?
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Never found out.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
Leave off..
You shaved.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Oh, man, don't say that..
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
What's this?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
What--
I was bowling--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Please!  Please!
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
No.  Here.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Well...no, of course not--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
What the hell is this?
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Walter--
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Right, Dude.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Well?  Aren't you?
Who the hell is he?
Oh, shit.
Walter--
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Recognize him?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
You don't want to go there.
Sounds like a plan.
Where were you, Whistler?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Thought you were dead.
You got something in mind, Blade?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
What the fuck you doing?
From his father, of course.
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Going on twenty years now.
Get in. You’re leaving.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Who dies first?
Is something wrong, my friend?
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
"The Blood Tide".
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Any progress?
Are you all right?
How long have we been driving?
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I don't believe that.
How many of you are there?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
How?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
Let's talk to your husband--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Oh, sorry, right.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Why is there no "our" here?
I think we get the gist.
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
--you should get back into bed.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Are you marked like this??
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
--Cotter: shut up.
Mi casa y su casa!
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Fucking owl!
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Yeah. Me too.
Who?
I'm not finished.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
How're the cameras doing?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
You gonna be alright?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Heather.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--it's urgent!
Your mother's pastor.
Yeah.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
On the phone. Was it for you?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Ray?... What time is it?
What do you want to know?
He needs a room, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Well now you do.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What day is it today, Angie?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
Those are my breasts.
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
He's comin' back?. What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Do you like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
Yes.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
It's okay. it's okay.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Oh yeah?
How is Central these days?
What else is new?. right?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
O.K.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey?. Why?
You like mysteries that much?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Yeah, I know.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
We want some grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
I heard.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
What type of planes do you have?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Derek Foreal.
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
I did not.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Yeah, layaway.
Who's the cheapskate?
Beautiful girls?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
That was a beautiful message.
Figured what out?
Source?  What about Derek?
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
She did that before.
Alright.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
What are you doing here?
Well, here I am.  See?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Yeah.
I don't believe you.
Swear on my life.
But I have a visitor.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
What ... What must I decide?
Sure. By shooting at me.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
And how many are we?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Go away!
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
You did a good job, Charlie.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
What about Miss Lawson?
Who found him?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Why not?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
We stopped seeing each other.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
You'll be sorry?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Oriental medicine.
October twenty-seventh.
No.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What about Miss Lawson?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Nothing.
Hello?
Yeah.
You and me -- making love.
Why would she lie?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Can I see you later?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
What's wrong?
I'm not.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
It's not that long.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
Eeeww!
Michael.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
They got heat in Michigan.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Want another cigarette?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Is the dizziness gone?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
You sound like an artist.
Why did you stop?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Francesca?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You really don't need anyone?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about if I set the table?
Have you ever been to that station?
Nobody's asking you to.
What were you like when you were younger?
I can't do this, honey.
Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
Stop it!
STOP IT!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
Yes. And I've accepted.
You feeling better Franny?
I can't sleep.
What's her name?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Then what do you care?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
What the hell you talking about?
Looking to score?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
What it will be.
How did you get in here?
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Why?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Bill!  Bill?!
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
That building?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
All right!  Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
Where is it?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Gimme the gun.
Not bad.  What for?
It's impossible!
But you know he did it.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
But it could be anywhere.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
What are you doing?
Stupid cunt!
But everybody is all right.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I should have let him kill you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
What?  They ain't there?
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Call me as soon as you get him.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Who?
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Maybe.
No.
How did you meet him?
He's a launderer?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
You said he washed the money?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
What is Treadstone?
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Sir, you waited on line.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
-- sir? --
Yes, I'm here...
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
-- you could put it together --
I don't know.
I needed a break.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Where?
No.
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
Sir...
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
What do I have to do.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
If I can help you ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Gillian Layton?
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Sam!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Am I?
Enough though, eh?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Shut up!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
It does doesn't it?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Every day?
What?
What?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
They're gone.
Don't you like parties?
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
You are good to me Sam.
What's the matter?
I did it for you.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
A woman eh? I see.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Uh ...
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Now look what you've done to him.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
The pace?
Are you expecting anyone?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
Mary said you might be coming.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I guess I'll be going.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
He's very very sick.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Five years.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I think I'd remember that.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Promise you won't go inside.
Who's that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Three legs.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
He one of them?
What do you think?
Last show of the night.
Where's Burke?
The brakes are shot.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Turn it off.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
He's crazy.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
I don't think so.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Yes.
Eventually rising to...
Good night.
What happened?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
No.
Then what was good about it?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Just a few questions?
Goodbye, Paul.
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Nobody else had it.
That's okay.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Uh-huh.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
Are you nervous, Walter?
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
Thank you.
Of course I do!
I like you very much, Walter.
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
What did he say?
You...made that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
You didn't mean to what?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I can't talk right now.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Smack?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Hi.
Why not?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
You're the guys from the movie!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Yes.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
What's Bobby gonna say?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You weren't home.  Like always.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Thanks.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Why?
Time to do what?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Not a pressing issue.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You are such a wet.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I want to die.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That is so cool.
Thanks.
What... are you?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Well, I hope so.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Wit-tay.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
The right nostril.  Good.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
How was that?
Nuke?!
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
What a nasty thing to say.
I'm trying to play with your body!
We lost.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
What's so great about baseball?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
How come you don't like me?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Go for it.
Party without me.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
Boring.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Forget it.
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
We'll pray anyway.
No.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Well, I'd rather not say.
Was I at that dinner?
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
What do you propose?
Excuse me.
Wait, hold on a second.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
702 472 1862.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Yeah.
Yes, you lost your control.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Yeah.
And what'd she want?
Sammy.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
No, Ace.
I...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
To Abraham Lincoln.
Who's this?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I - I - I...
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Yeah.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
What do you mean?
I gotta tell ya...
With the money.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Who were you with?
Hi, Sam.
Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Just wait there for me!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Don't you threaten me!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Well...
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
When I left here with the money...
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Oh.
He's gone?
He's not here?
For what?
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Hm.
I'll be right out.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Hi, Jennifer.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Okay.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You fucked with me for the last time!
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Promise?
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Get up.
She asleep?
You walk past me?
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
What's the matter with you?
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
What did you think?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
We're waiting.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
God, can you hear me!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
What did you say?
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
You think so?...Selina?
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
What's the name of your child's best friend?
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Hey, you're anti-male.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
What did--?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Okay, deal.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Maybe.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
You seem sad, Spooky.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
Make a "U" and go back.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
What are you doing now?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
No.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes sir.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
There isn't any such person.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Damned if I know.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
You're the man with the gun.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
You won't live to see it.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Some loyalty.
Stay there.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Negative.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Count it.
Don't worry.
Seems like it.
There's two police cars now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
In your dreams.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Who are you?
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So let's call this the usual.
He's what she should run a mile from.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
What would you call it?
He's still looking, Col.
Did I?
Thank you.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Do you mean that?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
How'd you guess?
Not me.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Piss off, Dave!
Someone out there.
He lived here with you?
Yes...
What do you think?
You say that like a gentleman.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Why?
Tell him it hurt --
Don't call me that.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Do they know?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Don't.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
What's her?
You could say that.
Afraid so.
You like me better like this.
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Died...
No.
You tried.
Love you, Dil.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
It's my name, Dil --
Do I?
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Can't.
I know.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
Who's the old geezer?
I take pride in my work.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Thanks.
So he knows your name?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
How is it a farce?
What's that?
You want to bet?
And you know the funny thing?
No?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Having two pints in the Rock.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
What do you believe in?
Is it bad?
I don't know her.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
How can I?
Like the one about the frog?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Nothing.
Faster than cricket?
What if I did?
Have you no feelings, woman?
All right -- where's the letter?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
Oh, you should see your face.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
When you come on, you really come on.
I love you, Adam.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Only we call them agents.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Agent.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Café.
Steal it how?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
You'd lie about anything.
Very pretty. Now what?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Carson Dyle is dead.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Who told you to do that?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Yes, I know.
What? Assassinate somebody?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Go on.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
And if it is?
Mrs. Lampert --
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
How do you know?
Charles is.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Come on. You can't stay here.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
I'm still having trouble with English.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
What was what?
On the street where you live.
Nothing. Good night.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
That's all.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Stop that!
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
I don't see him.
Yeah?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
You do?
I get all your CDs.
Good.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
She's my daughter, Tom.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I thought you'd be pleased.
Who is she Daddy?
St. Michael's.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
You fucked me up!
I'm sure you should have failed.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Go sit next to him.
You eventually have to talk to him.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Oh nice save.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
FINE. Are you?
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I can't right now.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
What?
I'm fine.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
My dad's down there!
Thanks for coming back for me.
That's what he said.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
And the police did nothing?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Ok.
What?


...that is going to explode...
...-ty.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
What did I say?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-tana.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 

You want cash?
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
What the hell's goin' on?
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...

Hey.
God-...
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.


I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
 Yeah...
...let live.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Holy shit...
Fuck! 
 Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
I know the likeli-...
Whoo!
 I made it.
Hang on!
 Okay.  Okay. 
He's crazy!



No!
It won't even start half the time.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...truck.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
I think you oughta cut a...
...or my conscience.
Listen, Arlo.
Huh?
Put your hand in my pants.

 All right.  Okay.


Oh, shit.
We!
  I've got the real thing!
Okay...
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
It's working.

...-ta get outta here!


Hello.
That's bullshit.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.

Hey, be cool.
...about him.
I did what I could for you...
Mason, you have to take this...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Is it--?
Doc-...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
You'll kill us all!
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...-ple.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Went away? 
Do you know what'll...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
I'll do it.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
Get your links set up!
I'm on it.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...general store.
That's right.
...scientists.
...should be right outside.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...

 
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Yeah?
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
There's something else too.
Go.
Kabula's out.
Hit it...
And where are you going?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
A man named Tim Ma-...
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...without caution...
...is death.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...seriously.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
  All right.

Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
If that's what it says.
Do you know him?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Too bad?
Maybe.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's just lovely.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Who?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
No.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
You and your husband never discussed her?
A complete surprise?
Would you like something to drink?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Never forgave him for what?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
What? What is it?
Yeah.
Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
He owns it. You know?
What does it look like?
Did you get some sleep?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What did you do that for?
Back to Mexico.
Where can we go?
Where'd he go yesterday?
I think I got something.
When did you come in?
Who?
Ida Sessions.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I don't understand.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes...
Yes?
Never.
What about the water?
That's a long fall.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
All she needed for that was the phone book!
So he says you sent them?
What's that, pal?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
What are you doing here?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
Why? What do you mean?
That's right, Modern Times.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
So what's that got to do with it?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Go on!
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Let's hope they like it there.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Charlie?!
Are they standing for me?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
I'm sure that's it. 
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
Oh yes, there is.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
A rooster?
Oh, me -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Half past eleven.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Don't tell me you're sorry.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Thanks.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Yes, sir. 
Can't say, sir.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
First of all - 
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Yes.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yes, sir.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Queer?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
What did you get?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Are you sure?
What the hell is that?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Can I watch?
Dick.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
You lie.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Like what?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Who are you to make assessments?
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You only brought one ball?!
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
What do you mean?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Empire.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Perfect dozen.
Nudie booth?
I know.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Pull my laces tighter.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
It's today.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm going with you.
You were saying?
How'd he die?
No!
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
And this is what you rented?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You're a snake.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Leave me alone.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
She's my girlfriend.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Meaning?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I said go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
What the hell was that for?
Who?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
That's because I never had sex with him!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Dante...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It was only a few times...
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You open?
Can I have your name please?
What's this?
Did he say "making fuck?"
I think the lady called it.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
You'll be missed.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
I... I don't know what to say.
I'm not sad.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Bye. 
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
I copy.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Take the gun.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Nice and easy...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Maybe lead to a flare up...
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He doesn't want my help.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Gabe are you alright?
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
It's up there, on the Tower.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
I don't know about totally.
What the hell are you doing--
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Richard Travers.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Who are they, sir?
So this is the young man?
Hullo.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
I beg your pardon?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
What job and how much?
Aye.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Crime?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
But it was horrible.
How are you feeling today?
Yes?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
You're not cured yet, my boy.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
You have, my son.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
Pitiful rookerful...
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
You like Bach?
Most of the time.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What's he sayin'?
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Who is this?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...why is everything always about you...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Like what?
You - you killed him?
With what?
Try some deep breathing.
Yes.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Yes, Max?
I never learned jazz.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for what?
You go every night?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
You get benefits?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
There you go...!
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
What happened to you?
Slow the hell down!
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I never told her.
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not for years.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
For what?
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
That's it?
I've been reading up on it.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Pretty scary, huh?
Never heard of him.
Has this happened to you before?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Did you kill him?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I don't know...
Can I ask you something?
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
And what did I say?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Dr. Arroway --
Hope there's a cartoon.
I disagree.
Peter sends his regards.
No doubt.
Ellie...
You know why I'm here.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie.
What would you have me say, David?
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
No primer.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
So who -- what -- are you?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Am I one... or many?
Now... you go home.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
What kind of deal?
The systems integration site.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Greenbank?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie --
That you, Valerian?
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Can you try?
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
The final countdown.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What...?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I can't hear this now --
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Lookit her bounce.
Go hard!
Tell us about it.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
But -- but --
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
He was lying.
I never hurt nobody...
You get me out first.
What book?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
For months... last October.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Halloran.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
Yes.  I have to go...
They all have one...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Absolutely.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Or the F.B.I.?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
There, that's better.
Have you seen his penis?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
One of your suitors?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I want to see my mother immediately.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
What about the engagement party?
How can I help?
It'll be fine.
Ecru.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Tell us every detail.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I gather he's late as usual.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Yes.
I'll see you soon.
Which flowers did you order?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm really not that hungry.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
But you're checking it out.
Very romantic setting.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
We'll get caught.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
I better make a list.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Michael.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Silly, silly, silly.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Well then why'd it happen?
Can I put these here for tonight?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Forget I asked.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the store.
That's a big question.
Especially now.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
No...
Here's the ring.
Oh.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
All tapped out.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Agent Hadley.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Hello?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm not here to negotiate.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
Why not just steal another one?
Because you're the closest.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
All right, knock it off.
What?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
-- Did you set it up?
I just thought that--
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
What'd they take?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
There has to be.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
I'm not going to leave you.
No.   How much?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
No.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
How are we going to do that?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
The money isn't here.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I didn't have the heart.
Where's your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I've missed you.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's just the dope, don't worry
You look like a rock star without a job.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Does it hurt?
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
We've got company.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
On my mother's life.
No.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Why not?
Give it up.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
That's none of your business.
I'm... I'm alright.
Sure. Have a good night.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
That's not fair.
Where are you going?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Where did you say she's from?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Okay.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
You think he'll like it?
Need any company?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Oh baby... oh baby...
I told you I don't know.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
You amaze me.
Yippy.
Yeah.
Shut up.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
And if I don't?
Ronald? That's crazy.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Yes, you already did.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Oh, thank you, darling.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Yes, darling,
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But wishes don't come true.
These are all from me.
But...
Will you be friend for always?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
But we don't have any sea weed.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Look at my ring.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
Mommy read it to ne.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
I mean where on your body?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Translation: a total geek.
Maybe he's just shy.
I think she broke the skin.
Where?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Hey, did you get contacts?
No, did you fuck him?
At least your PMS is over.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I think he called you beautiful.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Why not? There's been a murder.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I think George knows.
Hello?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
What?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
It's stupid.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Briefs.
I really gotta get going.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What's with the squirt guns?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
You at least owe me the truth.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
How do you know?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
No, it was our first date.
We can get a warrant if you like.
You can't believe this bullshit.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
They didn't have faces.
Where do you think this goes?
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
You've been working too hard.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
... What?
Bob...
And...
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You could buy it on payments.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
`Dave'?
Oh... Hi.
How'd you get started?
You're not?
Really?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You bet.
What?
... . Ellen.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Where's home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
What?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
So what do you do the rest of the time?
I know. I'm sorry...
They're crucifying you out there.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I missed...
We're all set,  sir.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
What is it?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Curse?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
How long do we have to watch him?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
You are dying, too.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
Oh God, it's over now!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, he's your roommate.
You what?!  How did you do that?
What are you doing?!
Sort of.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
I have to go home. Chet might call.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
A yawp?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Weird.
I'll take him over mine.
Yes.  But
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Er  No.
From you?
This play?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
The "come back" kind.
Yeah...
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Man, don't go up there...
She's gone...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where are you going?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
She fucked you?
I'll get the boots.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Tell him, Vince!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
I got delayed. I --
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
But you must come in.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
You are his friend.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
You should have put that on last night.
I just wait. You know?
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Yeah... I guess.
What do you think about?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
I thought you might be praying.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What?
What's that noise?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Where?
It's Merle, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
Yeah.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No!
Down.
What did you say?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Mug sheets.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Remember my promise.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
I got it.  I got it.
You my partner?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Why?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Yeah.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You should be in hospital.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
They always are.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
I didn't.
You're lying.
Why? It don't hurt.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
But I like the new one better.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
You're not -- Dorothy.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
It's mine?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
The seventh day of April --
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
But -- I was just lucky.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Why not -- ?
I think his leg is broken.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Well -- I -- I-
Isn't that your own fault?
You know that, son.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Of course not --
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Jabez ...
Hullooo!
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Where are you going?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
New York...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
'Roy'.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Al?  Al, you there?
Powell?  What's going on?
Bullshit.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
What's going on?
This is --
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Yes, I would.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
They're not after you, they're after me.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
How are you doing?
Well.... huh ...
So... that sure is something.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Where you gonna go?
What am I supposed to do?
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Yeah.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He's makin' threats in there.
You frisk me.
What the fuck do you want?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
I must of been outta my mind.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
They look like good kids.
Yeah.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I didn't eat any pizza.
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Yeah.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Pure?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
But I want to know what you think.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
No!
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
This is Bishop.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
What?
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
Okay.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What did he do this time?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
You the man.
You're a drunk fool.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
OK.  OK.
Eddie Lovell.
Wake up!
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
How many you say?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Don't worry about it.
It's a fucking shame.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Can you pay me now?
I would like to get paid now.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
How long then?
To get my money.
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
I'll do that.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
How do you know this?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Hey!  Watch it.
Pino, relax, will ya.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Four colors? Neato!
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What are you wearing?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
I think it's just over there.
Cool.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
She did not.
HARRY.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Nice jugs.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
...cause you said...
How do you know it's for us?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Me, me, me!
I know I did.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
You're just jealous.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
What?
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Sure.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
How was that?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
We start our own class?
Knock knock.
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
Everything?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
My Lord!
What does Leto say, Piter?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
What happens now?
We felt his presence.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Yes, Sire.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
No.  I don't work here.
Who are you?  What do you want?
I never thought of that.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Goulash.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
And, cut...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Isn't he?
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
You're a fuckin' mess.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Dolores, wait!
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
What is happening?
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Oh.  Congratulations.
I am.  How's your father?
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
Stop!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
You don't wanna be noticed?
You're sure this is gonna work?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Who?
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
What if--you're vomiting?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Did you see that?
What?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What?
Cool.
Yeah?!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Where are you going?
Mm...  Oh, man...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
She left.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Are you asking me?
I batted!
So maybe this is my dynamite.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Well, when you put it that way.
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Come on, let's go.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Kinda'.
What?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Who's Shari?
You don't recognize me.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Mm.
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Here they are.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I'm looking at new cars.
Why are you doing this?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
And how did you get in the school?
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
That obvious, huh?
Somebody hit you?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Tell me about Patchett.
So you saved her.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Call me Dudley.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
They're yours.  Take them.
Will you work for me?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Lynn.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Dudley.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Ellis Loew.
Richard Stensland.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Ed, I want confessions.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
What's this all about, lad?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Bud White's been here?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
What's her name?
No.
Really?  What did White say?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
When?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
And Reynolds?
Shut up!
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Really?  How?
Oh Jesus.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Told by whom?
Sorry.
Jesus.
Looks like Detroit.
Yeah.
Them.
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
What the fuck?!
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
Pretty fast.
Feeling lucky?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
What size?
That's my point.
Your stuff?
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
No.
I've seen it.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I know.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
It is fish.
Brill.
Brill?
Other than Brill.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
I've never met him?
What makes you think it's you?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Hey!
Listen--
Who would do that?
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
She can't talk to you right now.
No.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah.
I need help.
How can I reach you?
What does that have to do with you?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Who?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
We believe?
What about the tape?
Now is that clear?
Pardon?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
This is - what is this?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
We've got to get you out of here.
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Appropriate?
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Which we've overflown twice.
In my room.
I believe I'm rather late.
Right.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Okay.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Is this you?
I don't know.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
So was my Patient.
No.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Where've you been?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
The rest meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Apprentices.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
I'll probably marry him.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
It's what I've learned.
No.  He's - no.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
We're getting close.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Uh. I'm showing off.
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Do you mind?
I know.
Oh?
It's a test.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
And good morning.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Did I hear a car?
I didn't mean to get personal.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
We did it.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
What?
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Got it.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You shouldn't have.
You have something in mind?
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
Always in a rush.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Because I never assume anything.
You look like George Washington.
Remind me why.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You'll just have to have faith.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Yeah.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Is that what I think it is?
You wanna talk about --
No shit.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
What?  Who?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Whoa.  No shit.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
And, what, I'm not serious?
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Why not?
Morning!
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Did he say why?
You come to the right place.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
It happens all the time.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Why not?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Thanks for reminding me.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
You are someone.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Nothing.
I didn't say that.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
I can't ...
And that is why I must go.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
That's right.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Sir, I was wondering ...
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Yes, you do.
You mean a man you can control.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Are you kidding?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
What are you talking about?
Why not me?
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
But I feel The Force flowing!
I see a city in the clouds.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Did you call the Zoo?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Please
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
Can you land?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
What're you doing in here?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
What are they?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
At last...
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Because you and the land are one.
You.
Very well. Climb up.
A lovestruck page!
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
What honey?
Hi
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A stimulant.
Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
She used those words?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Sure did.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention her.
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
What else?
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
Captain who?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I don't know
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Well I heard differently.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Lieutenant?
Sure.
You might loosen the straps then.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Intensely.
In time.
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Amen
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Who's in it?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Fuck him!!!
Sometimes.
You're not going to drive.
You're not going to drive!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Beasley.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
How's the birthday girl?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Am I late?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Jack...
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
So what'd we get her?
So you'll come out, right?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
What's that?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Awe inspiring.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Yeah, fine.
Good idea.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Funny, huh?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
You always threw up.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Nothing. We get nothing.
What?
You weren't there.
What're you doing?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Spur of the moment.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
We're finished.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
So?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
Come on.
What do you think?
Shoes?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Fucking.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Jack, you with us?
Virgins.
Great?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
They never do, Mr. Barker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Is that the way it is?
You never sang before?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
He do that every year?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Huh?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Look, if you want to leave...
You don't pick your brother.
Vegetables.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Another five years, huh?
Guess they're up.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
I guess it's getting serious.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Yeah?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Drive.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
And this thing can grow it?
Or reactivated the first one.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
No.
One last time.  It's important ...
Is someone there?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
Not anymore.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
What are you -- stupid?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
I'm just having some fun.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You're wearing your suit --
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Great.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
How’d you know my name?
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Jack...don’t even start...
What are you doing?
Why not?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
No?
You really are incredible...
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
To Paris. Paris, France.
You’re not married, are you?
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
He's made a few changes.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What do you want, Vic?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I though we went over this.
Sweet.
You two need a time-out.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
But I'm not done with the machine --
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Raising the shields.
Victor, your scar --
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
What're you getting at?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Yes, Alan.
Difficult? He's impossible!
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Then how come it worked loose?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
I've done all I could with the laser.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Don't tell me they're refueling...
What about Dr. Michaels?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
I don't believe that.
I can't tell you.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
What's wrong, Skipper?
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Oh, yah, I know that!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Yah, he -
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
I unnerstand.
Ya got that right.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You bet.
Yah.
Huh? Yah?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Sir? Right now?
Yah, how much money was that?
Know who this is?
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah.
Okay.
Yah.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Call 'em up.
Hiya, Lou.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Well, how the heck are ya?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
No.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Oh, fine.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
He was killed in action.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
We need to talk.
No, I wasn't aware...
Dynamite?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
I'd like to thank the academy...
And I saw you practicing this...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
In case we want to switch nights.
What are you doing here?
What... ?
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
There?
Here.
You... don't have to... leave.
Chloe's dead.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
How have you been?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
No, supply oxygen?
...no ...no ...
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
How do you feel?
What fight?
Where's your car?
Okay... Ghandi.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
No, I'm not...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
What about Marla?
...stop me?
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What the fuck -- ?
NO...
... no, no, no...
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
I... I don't know...
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
Signs?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
What?
I've got to stop and help those people.
Yeah, so what happened?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
This is cheery.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Whoa, nine months?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What is it?  What are you?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
What feeling?
What on Earth are they doing?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Is that something you're "feeling?"
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Carter, get out!
Police are coming.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
"Next?"
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
It broke!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
No.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Ever do this from a jet?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
You read me, Brewer?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
What's this stuff on the rice?
It's a guy in a cage.
Can you handle the door gun?
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
Where did you find this clown?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Yes you can.
What was that?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
About 22 hours on site.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Meeting ... people.
Really?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
What if I was a relative?
You a friend of Parry's?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
I... I was just leaving.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
How un-sixties of you.
Which ones?
Your name was picked.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Oh, Lydia!
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
<u>What</u>?!
The Little People?
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
But I gave it to you!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
The Red Knight!
It's such a great song.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Divorced.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not some piece a crap.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Rayette.
What's your name?
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah, me, too...
How long have you been staying here?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
You were going without saying goodbye?
That's dangerous, you know.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Wait...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
All right, let's have a rematch.
Robert, I think you better just...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
What kind of doggy is that?
It's a Borzoi.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Steam.
Well, she was.
If you want to call it that.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Who are you?
Wussup?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
You got a boyfriend?
That's it?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
I kissed those girls.
Wussup?
Eddie from Compost?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
You gonna talk to him?
Wha'?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
You mean her.
I ought to get some sleep.
You're lucky.
Fletch.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Greetings, everyone.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Jesus.
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
My lawyer was a bum.
Are you serious?
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Fletch?
We can't talk about it here.
Because we can't.
I'm all ears.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
I'm still here.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Will you kill me?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Did you say cops?
Yeah.
Cute young thing, too.
She's cute as a button.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
So were my parents.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
You are a rich woman.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
I would, actually.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
The door was unlocked.
Where is she?
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Uh, almost.
Irwin...
I don't know.  Look!
I'd say charcoal.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
What...
Not really?
You don't know the Underhills?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
No, I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
So you...
Have what?
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You're saying you need money.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
How much?
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
You okay?
This is boring, guys.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
How's it going?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
How's everything?
Well try, okay?
What's your name, asshole?
I wasn't looking.
Allo... Salvatore...
Il est en retard.
What happens to the schedule?
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
What?
Where from?
Strike out, eh?
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Policy man in Queens.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
You got the warrant?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What I know is what I told you.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
Switches are shorted out.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
Damn.
Where's Johnny?
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
The future guy?
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Deleon.
Uh, hello?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What'd you say your name was?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
It's Mom.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
What are you talking about?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Yeah, I think so...
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Which means he probably knew her.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
She's pretty special.
I try to be.
No more... I can't!
I don't know...
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Derek... stop.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
No.  I got here just before you did.
What happened that night?
Could we move a little faster?
My whole world.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Are they following us?
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You don't "have to."
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Ahh, nothing.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
So where's Cort gone off to?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
I gotta get back to work.
Jesus!
Get up!
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
Really?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
I guess not.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
What's wrong?
What murders?
This is Jason's fault!
They're out of town.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
What a beautiful day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You had me worried to death!
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
I don't know what to say...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I got you a present.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Where are they?
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
She wants a divorce.
Asbestos lining.
Do not inhale.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She is kicking you out.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
Your father said you might be here.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
This could be it!
Pop, will you let me in?
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Life is good.
I don't know.
Don't worry. It's a test.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Why?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Alla puttanesca.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
The fact is, I have to get going.
He's a very sweet man.
Everyone takes his turn.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
"Hell!"
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
It's beautiful.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I dined at the prison.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
It needs work.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
A day or so.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Again?
Where are you taking her?
Will you be okay?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
In case you get back before I do.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Not that.
I was at home.
They found an eyelash.
Who are they?
There's a problem, Lamar.
What about them?
Assumed name... Houston.
It's all right.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
He must have.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Where are you going?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I don't know.
Come on, come on.
All right. Shells?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just fine.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
How?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Yes. I told him.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Jack, you're wrong.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You know Sid Fletcher?
How'd you know where I'd be?
Is he coming here?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
You sure about that?
I don't know.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
I left last year.
You all right now?
Yeah.
At me friend's house.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
How'd you know Albert?
Did they give you a rough time?
What is it?
You wouldn't.
No.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Nasty way to go.
Ask me?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
...they hold on to their money...
Well, I think I had one once.
All of, they got you on this "board..."
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
You...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
As an idea.
No.
Did I say that?
What will he pay?
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Oh, yes, George.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
...and rob the place...
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
You went for it.
It's a waste of time.
That's...
I am?
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No, who?
Thieves.
You think so?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Who used to say that?
Who told you...?
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Aaronow...
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
...I only...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
The leads are assigned randomly...
Then put me on the board.
Alright.
Alright.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
You are?
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
You sold eight Mountain View?
Eight units?
When?
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
...yes...
My wife told me to look into...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Kenilworth.
Did I...?
Yes.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
Yest...
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
I...
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What are the police doing?
It's nothing.
You just this morning...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Yes.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
I got lots of presents.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
What position did you occupy?
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I'm not afraid of his words.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Oh, 'scuse me.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I've always taken care of you.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Why didn't someone tell me!
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
They are everywhere!
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
You would have killed his brother?
Right here.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
How is his health?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
We got no choice.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
This looks corny.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
I didn't mean to...
Sure.  I loved it.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just that I was in the Marines.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
I never thought you were.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Do you miss it?
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
You're talking through your hat now.
Is that --?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Do you mind?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Thank you.
Yes.  Perfectly.
So what do I do?
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
It seems she neglected to mention it
Sound it out for me.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Not my girl anymore
Where you been, anyway?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's all microchips and shit ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
How you know that?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
The era when crime didn't pay --
I know ...
Where'd you find this one?
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Cut 'em...
What about The Club ... ?
No worries ...
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
Whatever do you mean?
Is he still working here ?
So she flies -
What about me?
Not --
Why don't you leave him alone?
Billy, how are you?
Tell him. It's okay.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What are you gonna do?
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
You what?
What about the schools?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
You ready?
Yeah, yeah.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
He's with his friends.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
I got dry cleaning.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Morgan, Let's go.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
Yeah, can I help you?
Fuck do you want?
What're those?
I don't know what it's called.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will.
Thank you.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Good to see you.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Sean...
About thirty million to one.
What's the point?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
I go places, I interact.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
That's very presumptuous.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
285.
No.
What does?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been on a plane.
Fine.
Why not?
So Christ, call her up.
Hence, the word remarried.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Not to me, they're not.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Oh, I know.
It's not...
That's what you want?
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I really don't 'date' that much.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Yeah.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Bullshit.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
I want to meet them.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
No.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
And you're sure about that?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Short fella. Pale face.
What's it to you?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
Crate fell on me.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
And you ain't ashamed?
She's settlin'.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Sure do.
Lookin' for a job?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I didn't mean nothing.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I like the tent better.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Granma's dead.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
He was a good man.
Are you crazy?
You mean get off my own land?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
You people looking for work?
Yes, sir.
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You're so funny...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
What's your business?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
Yes.
You look beautiful.
--She's not dead---
...About five years now.
Jesus Christ!
That's probably a good idea.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Yes.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
No harm no foul.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Did you see Blank in there?
They're not happy, sir.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
I bought a new rug.
What's a revival tent?
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
That's too bad.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
When I was first married.
Enjoy the day.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Everything under control?
I am comfortable.
Show me again.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Maybe they should put me down too.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
How long is this going to go on?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Did you ask him to come visit?
You got everything you need?
I'll take care of it.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
What?... Oh baby...
Why should they?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
It's me.
I should be in by two.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
We're very lucky.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
And you think it's best if I don't come.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
What do you mean?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
You don't seem to upset?
Promise?
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Diane!
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Are you afraid of anything?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
Jude, you okay?
What, sweetheart?
I know. Amazing.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
What stuff is that?
That's far out!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
One-handed!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Cereal.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Revenge.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
What's this one eat?
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Think you can do better?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Why did he come to you?
Alright, so what have we got?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
555-4202.
Purpose of visit?
What?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Is there another key?
Its too late.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
I do.
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Sure it does.
Hi.
It was the nightmare man
Jamie!
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Oh Christ. Doc...
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Jamie! Get away!
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
It's been totally charted.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Sure, see you later.
I wasn't spooked.
Thanks.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
I'm scared.
I don't want to.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hey, Laurie...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I don't like that story.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Of course not.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I couldn't if I tried.
Oh, good...
Mmm?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Yeah.
We're a big hit.
Oh!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
What?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Yes.
It's really sad.
Hi, Dusty.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Like, uh...?
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Where are you headed?
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
I'm...all right.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, you-you have that one?
I was looking for you.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I thought you weren't coming.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
No.
She has all the cooking talent.
Are you in a bad mood?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Get his wine away.
I am... I did slave all day.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
No.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Why?
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Wow!
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Ohh?
Oooo.
Oh?
Awwww...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
No!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Probably not.
Come on.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You're kidding me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Yeah.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Oh!
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
When'd you get here?
Tch.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Or, perhaps...
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
You want me to be?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Not with any certainty we...
Seen what, sir..?
You give me whatever I want...?
What would <u>that</u> be?
What reaction?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
...young boys, still...?
Mmm...
Sir:
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
I don't <u>think</u> so...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
You nervous...?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waal...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
You know America?
Darling...
...long overdue.
We got KittyKat...
And you let her get away.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Every suicide kills two.
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Then we cannot go.
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Hello....?
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know it well.
....that's right.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
For approval.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
...sir...?
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Man, she's losing it...
Freeze!  You're busted!
What are you gonna do about it?
Mine!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Gee, thanks.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
No.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
S'okay....
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Your son's dead and you love him.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
The bomb, asshole!
Cool off, we're seniors.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Look who I've found!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I'm not hungry.
Can I go now?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
is very angry.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Mummy!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
What?
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I'm coming with you.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Sure plenty of times.
No.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What's the occasion?
Ambrose. I know.
I said she's been missing for-
You're alive...
What evidence?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
What do you want?!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Nothin'.
He waited for you three hours!
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
She's talking to him now.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
You test each one thoroughly?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
No, no, no, no.
Who doesn't?
Right.
Yeah, that was easy.
Everything breaks at once.
Isn't that always the way?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Uh huh.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Neil -- what --
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
What -- what are you doing?
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Who was that?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Is it a king or a queen?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Tough.
Anything from the bank?
Where were you last night around nine?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
I hear you.
That's all?
Thank you, Thomas.
She's a treasure she is.
Aye?
Different places.
Why not?
Why?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
Are you a cop?
If it's good advice.
Because it's my name.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Be careful, Conner.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I love you, Conner.
What are you doing?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
You should warn them, Sonny.
He knows better than that.
Who sent you?
You won't die if you let me help.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Jesus.  What is this?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Use more ice.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
I got the gasoline --
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Keeps to himself, more like.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
You leave that gun alone!
Want one?
You gotta pee?
He said something about a girl --
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Is something wrong with Jane?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Chief, base.
You have her cell number?
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Are the disks still in your room?
These disks . . . where are they?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
We, who is we?
Excuse me?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Name a price.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Will you protect us.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
You will tell them the truth.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
When will they be here?
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Where are we going, sir?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I would never do that.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
Our cards, please.
This time the Militia will kill us.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
No.
I couldn't help.
The president has been murdered.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
But who is left?
What for Paul.
What's the matter?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
What sort of plan?
You have taken business class?
Out? Where are you going?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
There are soldiers.
Where?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's complicated. But don't worry --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
What are you playing here, Price?
What?
'Less the place really is haunted.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Why not?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Good point.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Steven --
You think this is fucking funny??
I think...I may have the answer.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Good way to get your head blown off.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Rewind that.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Price!
Please.....anyone....help me?
Sara...?
-- I'm coming --
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Did you find her?!
A few years older, perhaps.
She's down...
We're going to go someplace new.
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Where is she?
Help me!  Please!!!
I can't move!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
The heater's here.
No.
What are you talking about?
I think everything's ready.
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Should I...
Maura, what is this!
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
What was she afraid of?
Thank you.
Keep talking!
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
What will he do?  What does he want?
So where is it?
Wha .... ?
What?
Sorry.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
How have you ... ?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
What am I looking for?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Joey?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Really?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
You got about five minutes and change.
Did I miss anything?
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Count of three?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Anna, what are you trying to say...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
That's what you theenk.
Oh, you read that.
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Thanks for sharing.
Why does this have to be so hard...
Sharp.
It's hardly the same --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
He didn't offer you money.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, no, really, I --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Oh, is that it!
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...You do?
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
...Certain people are --
You know, on farm route 17.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...Why, this is worthless.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Yessir.
...This'll only take a moment.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
But, sir! --
Not that way! Through the door!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
How's that, Sid?
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Maybe he's wise.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Where?
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You don't believe in it?
Mrs. Rand.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
I like her already.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Well?
You wanted to warn me...
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
So maybe you'll come too?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
This just isn't the best moment for this.
That this was going to be a key party?
Ready to go?
I'm fine dad.
Yeah.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Birth control.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
You want coffee or something?
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
It's really quite all right.
How'd you know?
That's right.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Reverend Edwards.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
You going to tell dad?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
What time is it?
Right.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Yeah.
I love you.
I don't know. How do I know?
Good.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
How much closer would you say you were?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
That's right.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
What is it?
Ran like hell to go to him...
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
It was like some big fucking secret!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Then there is nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
You said there were none.
We can do that?
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
What night? What do you mean?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
This is no performance.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Then my luck would have changed.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
You've just done it -
The crucifix -
What have I done?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I don't pretend to know.
Why do you do this Lestat?
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
That's all past, Lestat.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
Shall we go on?
No... it can't end like that...
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
No.
I thought you were out of town!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
I'm the King of the World.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Can't what?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
I don't know.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Deep breaths --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Julie? What's wrong?
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I trusted you.
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
To a great weekend --
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
We'll only be a second, okay?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
You're just talking nonsense.
My friend -- what can one say --
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Woman, what are you doing here?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
You are my friend.
The General threatened me.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Good morning, sir.
Carter –– bank examiner.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
By letting me help you.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
It isn't me!
Made what?
I . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Where? I don't see a thing.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hey, Ernie!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
What?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
No.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
He's pretty young for that job.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Say, where's Mother?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Hey, George . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Yes, sir.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Uh-huh.
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Well, why don't you say it?
Too young or too old?
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
I'll take it. And then what?
Have you made up your mind?
Didn't you tell her?
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Where're you going?
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Great!  Find one for me.
Shut up.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
The lighthouse?
Coming up!  Give way!
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Chief?
Not the drugstore!
Do I have to?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Too late, it's written.
The Shark's mouth.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Can't you tell?
Let's get the kid home.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
I know what you're going to say.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Sean's asleep.
What's wrong?
That you were fired.
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
What is it?  What's the matter?
We have to do something.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Where the hell is Air One?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Did you say Cable Junction?
Hang on!
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Ready?
Who'd you ask?
That's a crock of shit.
Maybe it's gone.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
But first, a little juice....
And second?
Figure they split?
Until we find something.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
What's the lighthouse?
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I want Fruit Loops!
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
What is it, 97 days?
And what else is bothering you?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Honey... you all right?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
That we swim.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
After what happened to us?
Here.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
They said you'd be here.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Are you okay?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I'm sorry.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Afraid I can't do that.
Still sleeping.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
That's because I am the shark.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
He's big as a bloody bus!
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
Musclehead?
He's missing.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
How come?
Let's go, let's go!
Take it up!
Hold still, damn it!
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
It's not closing, Mike.
Got a job for me?
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Come on, let's go.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Where are you going?
What the hell are we arguing about?
I have work....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
All he did was kiss me....
Whatever happens next.....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
We'll be there....
The fish.  Check it....
A big one....
Yes!
I like Grandma's cooking....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
It's late....
You look tired....
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Promise me....
No....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I can't....
How do you like flying?
A big one....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
Yes I can....
I hope she's a good sailor....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Still tagging conch?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
She's a tough lady....
I made them, man....
Put me down....
Money is money....
When we got the grant....
Okay...we got it together....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
How long?
I didn't ask you to....
I'm going down, Jake....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
She's in management....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Oh no--
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Is it your vehicle?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I'm asking it.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
What if we need a back up?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Three or four.
Once.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
I know.
He don't know that. I didn't.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
What does that mean?
How you doing on those shoes?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
He's happy, darlin ..
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
That's right.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
No.
No one has ever dumped me.
I see what you're saying.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
No no. I knew.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Truth?
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Same to you.
Oh God.
If I said that, would you stay?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Said who?  Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I'm sorry, I --
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
No.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Thanks for coming.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
To the pools?
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I don't see any.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Sorry.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
That's him. That’s Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
No, it's...
Well what?
You had the phone the whole time?
NO!
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
A well-accepted theory.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
How did you know?
Any damage?
What?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
I don't believe you.
I'm not going, John.
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
But he's the head of InGen!
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I don't even know this woman.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I could come with you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
?!
Head for the roof!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Funded by whom?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
-- way we could safely --
You're sure we have to?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Carousel.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Why?
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Oh, shit.
- - like birds - -
- - barfs them up - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Come on, let's go.
Hola, Juanito
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
What are we looking for?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Listen, ahh - -
These look kind of familiar.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
That's a good idea.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
Machines hate you?
Where does he think he's going?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
What?  What can we do?
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
It's safe.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I'll stay awake.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I hate trees!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You want to put in chain saws?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah?
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Three.  Where's my client?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
You think that's going to work?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Doesnit sleep?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
How do we prove it?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten minutes...
My assistants, I presume.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
Did you see him?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You wanted to see me, sir.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Well, I --
In a small way.
I've never seen you here before.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Why were you given notice?
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
I've heard of it happening.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
-- Listen to me --
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't know.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
I'll bear that in mind.
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- You seem amused.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
It's ... lovely.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Give it back!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Why? She's a junkie.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
How would I remember?
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
-- OK --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Well do you think it was him?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Why?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Please.
What am I supposed to say?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Mm.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I am.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Some mistake perhaps that --
Well --
I wanted to give it to you first.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Nobody's seen that.
Does that distress you?
What do you have here, Billy?
What do you like best about your daddy?
I'm sorry.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Is this really your desk?
Uh huh...
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
What don't you understand, pal?
Sustained.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Is that...permanent?
I...I don't know...
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Oh, no..
John?
Any prospects?
You ever see her talk to the walls?
No.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
You ever think about getting married again?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
No.  I don't think so.
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Where are you from?
Mama, my story.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
I will be back in a few days.
It is an island. American territory.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
And, America?
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
But, I have no experience.
Like my mother.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Thank you.
Why are we landing?
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
We'd only just met.
Was he a good man?
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
How big do the bears get?
Why are you here?  Really.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
You sure?  I don't mind...
It was... something meeting you.
Are they feeding?
He just came up screaming.
This is a little different.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
What kind of backup do we have?
What?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You're sort of a rude person.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
You threw it at me!!
What is this?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Wild guess.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
I don't know! Get me out!!
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What do you see, Starling?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
But if he knew we have so little time -
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
I am, yes.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I never thought about it.
Mmm. And what else...?
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
No. We just -
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
But you could. You did.
Where were you going?
Yes...
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Your "father"?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
What?!
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
When? How?
Some say that's the way of it.
Will you consider that?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
I don't understand!
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Got a reason to stay.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Such as...?
Granted.
You mind if I take a look at this?
What's wrong?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
It's got Hazy!
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Go on!
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Shit!  He sent them all.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Shut up, all of you.
Charge set?
Twenty minutes...
Okay, number 23's full.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
You read Russian?
Bullshit.
Still bothering you?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I'm going to try to remove it.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What on earth's the matter with you?
Don't spend all day down there.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
They were going to pay, then?
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
What they like then?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
What the hell are you doing here?
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Who's "they"?
I do, sir.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
You're dismissed.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Come on in--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
He's still pissed off about it.
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Hey, Mikey--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
This is an official visit, then--
And people make their choice--
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
You have somebody else out there?
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Tell that one, Hollis--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
You go by your old house?
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Morning, Hollis.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
The Perdido thing?
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
There must have been somebody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I've seen 'em.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Okay? He's not here?
You gonna stay out here?
Can I get this?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Three months.
It was for personal consumption.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
Yeah.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
You're out early.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You know who it was?
Name's Otis.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
My life was too weird for her.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
I don't want him getting in the way.
Anything?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
He's good.
They won't tell you anything.
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
He was the real thing, right?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
What then?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
I saw him in Vegas once.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
A Mister Quaid?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Hold on.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For an introduction.
How the fuck do you do that?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Did she know where Nix was buried?
You didn't try hard enough.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Call me tomorrow.
Have we met before?
Swann?  What are you doing?
No!
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
No, how about you?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Ok, whatever you want.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
Oh.
How old is she?
What happened to your toe?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
I don't think so.
My stockings.
What are you talking about?
Tomorrow.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Why do you have to defend her?
See you later.
What?  That's horrible!
I'm still shaking.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Seemed...on edge.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh my God!
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
And the point is?
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Peter, let go of the chair!
When's your birthday?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What about after?
Plenty of time.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
He was trying to tell me something.
Maya?  What do you mean?
You know what?  You can go.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
What do you mean by that?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
Thanks.
Damn, girl.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Mom tell you to do this?
This brother from my college.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Thanks, Sidra.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
For real?
Your Dad play?
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
For how long?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
I can't be nice to a fan?
It's okay, little baby.
She understands.
Quincy...
Who was that?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
You weren't at my game.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
Never had to.
What?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
So why'd you give up ball?
What?
I'll play you.
And what happens when you lose?
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What is this?
You hearing me?
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Your teeth are straight.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It was scary though.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
...what the fuck is this...?
GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
Bit messy.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
You wanna go on a date with me?
Really?
Well I don't go out very much.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
ok.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
I'm sorry --
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Ready to go,go,go?
Have you ever been there?
What?
I don't know.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Son, don't --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
DAD --
It's ok --
I'm a rapper.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
Yes.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
-- just to clarify --
Not really.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Where are you from originally?
Not a problem.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Kind of.
Is Linda here?
How long have you taken care of him?
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Marcie.
No.
You look great.
...you know...
Then what?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
How you doing?
No.  No.
Well maybe.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
I'm sorry.
You don't want any water?
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
The fuck is wrong with you?
I need this one.
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
What is that?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
What had you to do with this, Mother?
A body.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
I have it all worked out.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
He seeks redemption.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
What do we do now?
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Athos, please...!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
Who came?
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
You would do that, your Majesty?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
What do you need?
You can cut the shit, asshole--
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
I'll take the south end -
Did you start out area six?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
A bank?
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I'm stranded out here.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
How long do I have?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Not the Bible?
Where?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
What?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
You worked out well.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Who is it?
Me.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I'm very scared.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Come in.
Dr. Chilton.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Hi, Linda. ..
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Okay.
He's misunderstood.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What the hell can I do?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
To do what?
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
I remember.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Will it keep them out?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
I figured I'd ask you...
She got all right?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
George, I hate sitcoms.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Cue the commercial!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
What do you mean?
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Popcorn?
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
I'm gonna quit.
"Philosophically"?
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Why is he saying these things?!
Sure...
It's my name.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
And you are?
Oh shit.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
What?!
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Did you hear that?
He had an accident.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Five.  Since I've been here.
I got you.
What is he doing?
What the fuck do they want with me?!
It's an honor.
Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What truth?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
For what?
Morpheus, I don't know --
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
How do you know that name?
They're watching you, Neo.
Why?
What?
Did you go to her?
Are you all right?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Why?
What?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
What are they doing to him?
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
What are your plans?
That means it's good.
Well, we want good stuff.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Look at her.
Kennedy.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Panther...
Next time, bet with your own kind.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Didn't show up.
I could have told you that.
Don't come any closer!!!
Let's get out of here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Back so soon.
No.
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
OK, ok...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
You getting out too?
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Hey, where you been?
Teresa.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Well, maybe you missed something?
Nothing.
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
It's all right.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
The girls like it loud.
Count it.
Yeah.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
You ate?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Did you speak to the Governor?
That was 'Joe'.
Annie made them.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
Do they, m'dear?
That you've been to Susan?
Honey, please.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
I thought you were buying my company.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Well... goodnight.
We have an arrangement now.
No, I don't --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
Me, too.
Yes.
'Just kidding'?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
You're overthinking it --
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
You loved back?
Yes?
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I'm lost.
I've got plenty of friends.
And I'll be a visitor.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Excuse me?
It comforts you, doesn't it?
...No.
I loved it.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
Well -- I --
'Love will find out the way'?
-- Yes?
Joe, that's the kitchen.
When you go, I go.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
No.
Uh-huh.
What way would you put it?
'Fish'?
Yeah.
You're what?
Which is what?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Okay.
Joe, don't do this --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
An offense --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Take me'...?  Where?
What question?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Bravo.
Thank God.
What is it, Daddy --?
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
You and 'Honey'?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Not at all.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
79.
30.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
Why?
Interested in buying one?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You know him?
Why?
Where is he?
Yeah, I hated it.
Did you?
Help me.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
My boyfriend told me about you.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I enjoy it.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You know it?
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You're living.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
So was he scared?
Why are you following me?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
What cop?
Lemon or lime?
Turn around.
He any good?
Yeah?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
What do you think?
Okay.  You got the "item"?
How many?
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
It goes very fast.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Died in childbirth, having me...
Is it December?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
What...?
Red light, green light, José?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
And there's Dmitri...
So?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
To the limit.
How much we looking for?
Verdado where?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Twenty on my man...
Go ahead.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Alonzo...!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Yeah.
...and thanks for the flowers.
What's it say?
Equipment?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You think I'm lying!
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
What's in your socks?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Don't say nothing about you either.
You got a comb?
They wrong?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
The kids? Why are they...
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
The Hilton.
Why'd you do it, Billy?
For the money... )
DAD!
Where are the minefields?
Stupid.
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
And you?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
What do you mean?
And?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
After we're outside the kogus?
Max - where?
What?
Never was anybody like you...
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
His name?
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Its muscles are locked.
You feel anything?
The kid's with them!!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
I heard how you talked to him.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
It's me. Can you hear me?
Peter-
Ah...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
Sure.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Here.
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
The phones are working?
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I know how that can be.
I'm...
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
--cliff-hangers--
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Hey, Pete.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
That'd be a first.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
You won.
What are you talking about?
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Before we kill her or cure her..
And the check's in the mall.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
They've got a book for this?
And six billion in the world.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
And that's the only reason?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
What did you think you were doing!
No.  Should I?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Twice.
'Terrorists?'
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
You mean it'll be difficult.
She sacrificed herself..
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I do.
I don't.  No exactly.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Roger that.
She must still be on the property.
A visit from an old friend.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
To friends.
Satisfied?
Always.
I'm walking.
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Are you damaged?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
What kind?
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Why should I?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Give me the God damn gum.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Tell you what?
What problem?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
- and picked us up in the States -
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What's going on?
Itís not working.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Ti amo.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
And what did they say?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Fast.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I was dead.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
What about Johnny?
I've never seen a moon like that.
Don't just become excited.
She didn't like me.
Why not?
Hi.
Hi.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
How can you ask me that?
No, I'll tell him.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
What?
I don't understand.
Seven-thirty.
A month from today?
Who is he?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Hi.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Your hair's different.
No. Are you drunk?
I know.
Don't make yourself sick.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Sure!
Will you join me for dinner?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm freezing
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
She's got it.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Where did you get the coconuts?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
We don't have a lord.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Had enough ... ?
I'll do you for that.
You're a looney.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
There.
Well ... I AM king.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Bloody peasant! 
Sorry ...
Exactly.  So... logically ...
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
To seek the Grail!
Here's one!
Well taken, Concorde!
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Leaving the room.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Right.
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Sir Galahad!
Well, she's got a point.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
I speak as I find, Archie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Gesture?
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is quite late enough.
How will I know?
I'm sorry?
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
I am a blank sheet.
Dare say you can be taught.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
I'm fine.
I wouldn't know.
For Her Majesty.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
What?
Who by?
That doesn't make him an expert.
Must they always follow us?
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
This is my good John Brown.
The question is, do we need her?
A fine choice, sir.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
I have a letter, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
What is the matter with him?
Does that thing work?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
But how can it change every time?
Dead?
What's her problem?
Hello?
Happy?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
That's what I thought.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
What are you going to do?
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Alex...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I'm okay.
Go for it.
Which way?
What did he do to you?
Mom?  You're alive...
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
No.
Someone's shut off my money!
The Cowboy??
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Sure.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
Well, I ...
Right. See ya.
There was an accident. I came here.
You're still here?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Yes, there was.
Yes?
No...I need to sleep.
Okay.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
Betty Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Palmdale.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
You must come in first place to move on !
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I'm working on it.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Not listening !
We drown.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Do you know where you're going ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Is it over ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Yes sir.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
What's next ?
Thank you very much.
Hi. I brought some wine.
What an incredible view !
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Umm, where do you want this?
Do you still teach?
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
How did you know my name?
I don't think you're very polite.
Don't mention it.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Do what?
You want me to move?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
She's beautiful.
What are you staring at?
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Your mother?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Don't wake up Vada.
MOM!
Thanks....
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
And I thought I was weird.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
DON'T!!!
In the tar??
Like what?
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
This is it I guess.
Oh...what's that?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
She'll be all right baby.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Well maybe for you.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
What do you mean?
Really?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Of what??
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
The boss is watching us...
You are perfectly healthy.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
What Hurts Vada?
I need the job.
Uh huh?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Harry, I really think she.....
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Hi.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Here?
This is where we are.
Rock?
Yes.
It's only eight o'clock.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Ahem.
What?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
She likes to play bingo.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He was allergic to bees.
I found this.
Really?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
This is one big house for one single person.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I paid the money.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I won, I won!!!
Goodnight.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
I'm trying.
No, I don't wanna.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Get up!?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
No.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Blood oath.
You think...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
I give.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Well, we're...
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... look good on Kimberly.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It doesn't say th...
And she's all wrong for me!
W...
Such as.
She finds him "personable."
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You miss her, huh?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Dance card filled?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Oh, yeah.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
What is that sup...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Maybe it's happy there.
Well, that just happened that time.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I hate that music.
You're from out of town?
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
What's wrong honey.
You have to what?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
What's wrong with her.
You going today?
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
They can come to the concert in the park.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Barbara Jean.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
President?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Harvard?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
She had on high heels?
You in music?
What kind?
What year?
Mom?
Oh... Well.
Fungus?
I want to get the dog off my bed.
When I was little, in church.
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Who is this?
Who is thin?
Hello.
Thirty?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
That's what you said before.
Premeditated murder.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Oh, no.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Sleeping.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Oh?
Do you study at all?
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Ah... Peter Finch.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
What did you think then?
Who is we?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
I can appreciate that.
Lobotomy Bay?
What?
You guys stay on your bellies.
Ready.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
Tell me about the purity.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
And they made the first move?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How so?
But you'll never be whole again.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
You think so, Frankie?
You a union man?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
How 'you doing?
His profession?
You working?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Are you married?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Don't push me, Duff.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
You jivin' me?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't deny me, Duff.
You will.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
A whole lot, Frankie.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
What's on your mind?
She don't look no worse to me.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
How are you?
I doubt it.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Let's stay here, Will.
What's the matter now?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Can you get us into Straylight?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
What are you talking about?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
You ran without us.
What's this?
Prepping your trip.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
What elders?
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
No problem, amigo.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Hello, Case.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Where did you here that?
I know who you are.
You've been calling her name.
That's not going to help.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Yeah... fine.
He projects with neural implants.
...And if I guess wrong?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Okay. That's bad.
Now this is cute.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Anita!
Do I want to be crunched?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Gus?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Is that true?
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Our penguin, right?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
He <u>has</u> to know...
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Just what?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
You got your room straightened out yet?
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Jesse, help!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry...
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
What?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
Are you okay.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
So, you feeling anything?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Morning.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I used to live in this house.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Can't be good news coming from you.
What are these, beauty marks?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
It's been a long time.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
This is nice.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Just until we get things under control.
So do I.
Try me.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What was that?
Cooling down.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Uh, fourteen.
We're here.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Busy tomorrow?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
So who left who?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Eleven.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Sorry about that.
I haven't decided.
Can I have your autograph?
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
No -- it's my 22nd.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
I did.
Right -- want another one?
Buggered?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Which was?
What?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
How was she?
Excuse me.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Yes, that is correct.
Y-y-y-yes...
I was in luh-love with her.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Yes, ma'am...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
You men remain seated!
Welcome back.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Ahhh, Billy...
Yeah...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With your own two hands?
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
No!
Yesterday...
Yeah, Mac?
Yeah, it's cold!
In what way?
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
When?
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Yeah!
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Yeah...
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
How 'bout twenty?
Evenin', ma'am.
Yes, ma'am...
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
I thought so.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
I'm a liberal!
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Who's this?
Damon Bradley...
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Does he love you?
Why?
Oh.  That's nice.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hello.
Any night.
Well, to-- new friends.
I don't believe in statistics.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Is he gay?
No.  He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
I know.  You're right.
No...  I can just tell.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
We're saved!
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
'Course he does.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I never even got to be single.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Hi.  Where've you been?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
It was a ouija board, remember?
My God... you're right.
And he is living proof.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Huh?
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
What?  You know him?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
And you didn't tell her?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Right now?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
What the hell!!!
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Hello, Edie.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What makes him so special?
I'll get home all right now.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
How would you've done it?
How do you like that one?
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Listen, you like beer?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
You haven't finished your beer.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
What are you going to do?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
Edie...
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
My pigeons... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Where you goin'?
What are you going to do?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
What do you want from me, Father.
Give me that gun.
...walk?
D 'n D?
Nice fellows.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Never will be much too soon.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You'll work.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
So-so, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Listen, Johnny—
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
The ropes are coming loose.
Nothing is worth your life.
You're talking nonsense.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
Ahh, she will be yours.
The moon is almost gone!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
You mean...!
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Then why do you shake so?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
No. No! No!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
He wants us.
Yes.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Why not?
He called the day he escaped.
Did you know that when you married him?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Just that she got away.
I'm a tourist.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
You talked to him?
You'll have to ask him.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Who?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Let's go outside and talk.
You know how to use one a these?
Not until recently.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Uh-huh.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Bleeding on a country road.
You'd probably tell me.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
You did?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
So she did help you?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
In the trunk?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
Okay.  How many going out?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Uh-huh.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Me?
Hi, Ray.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Got run over by a car.
What're you doing at Glades?
We don't get to talk much any more.
"Hey, yourself."
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Not at all.
He waved to you?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Thank you...
Well, I need that...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
You liked that?
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Good shooting, Rafe!
I was grieving too.
Fuck you.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
Have the planes made it to China?
Learn English, then!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Hello, Lilla!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Peggy Sue!
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
You drive like a maniac!
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Where did you get that sweater?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Come back to me.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Yes, sir.
Are you for real?
Terry! Slow down.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
I'd love to.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I closed my Christmas club.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
How do you feel?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Who was that man?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
You look exactly the same.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
What will they be made of?
Will you take of f your blouse?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I was building a doggy door.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
I think so.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Why, Beckett?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
One hour!
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
I'm ready...
Ready for what, baby?
Thanks, Charles.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
About my blood work?
Client of yours?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Kids are great.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Continue.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
What's her name?
They didn't fire her?
We're friends of Beckett's.
I'm a law suit.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I know a good probate lawyer.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Absolutely.
Where's Dad?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
Objection!
We won.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Jesus.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
What? What is it?
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Had it with deals.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
How many bottles?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Let's wait on the power cells.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Some prophet guy?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
A toast to whatever he just said.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
The best. But we won't need them.
The blood transfusion.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
The evidence was very meager --
You didn't think so then.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any particular reason?
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Huh?
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
I want her.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Why special?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Sustained.
What about me?
No.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
What about it?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Come on you can do better than that!
Where's Elias come from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Nah...
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Whew! - where that come from?
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
You don't want to hear about it?
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Well..
I really don't know.
Okay. You win.
How careful should I be?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
See anything?
Frozen.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Magruder does.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Who told you I was married?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Where's you get it?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Points very straight to her.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
You asked for it.
Private eye?
For five hundred, what do I get?
For two hundred?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
So you're not a cop.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
Information.
It could have been an accident.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Go live in a tent.
What do I get for it?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
You can find out.
No suicide.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
Nice.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I have a rough idea.
What's this?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Yes.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Both dead.
Who?
I haven't really thought about it.
What did he want?
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Bastard.
To the Fleet.
Let me see.
Why not sit down and wait?
Oh, I see.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
I'm not here.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
What have you got there?
We'll see what we can do.
No.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
That's the point, isn't it?
Johnny, it's the only way.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
What do you want?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Who's the girl?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I... I gotta go.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Tyler, put the gun down.
What do you mean?
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Thanks.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Your uncle will like this.
Storage, I think.
Congratulations, sir.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Yes.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
No, you look like a hooker.
Sit... and spin.
So do day jobs.
Get in.  This side.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Why?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
It's a very good year.
Just a romantic, that's you.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
It'd cost you.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Why not?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What if I lose it?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
You're packing.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Give me twenty minutes.
Carlos had some great rock.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
You bullshittin' me?
And who is that?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Then you would use your--
Me?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Get out!
He will come for me.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Well ... you were dead.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Will this do?
You want me to read this or not?
Okay.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
And our assets?
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
What? What?
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sixty-five.
Sorry.
We'll wait until you're ready.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
You're that smart?
You've made your decision then7
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Yes sir.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Good, what is it?
Here, don't panic.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
What did I do?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
To failure!
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
I solemnly swear...
Hindenburg...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
We won.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
What?
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Anyone at home?
What's your interest?
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
She'll need both of us.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Well?
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Of course we will.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I'm thinking of it.
You have a vacancy?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
A man should have a hobby.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
Phoenix?
Crane.
That's it. 
Is anything wrong?
Mary is Lila's sister?
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Do what?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
Did you wish to see someone?
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
How do you do.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Well, I do say it.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
We'll be coming to the opening.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Let me go! Let me go!
You mean he was colored?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Oh, is that what caused it?
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Good night, sir.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
I've been dreaming about this.
They're filthy, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
You better quit that.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
He did?
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, a little.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
What are they doing, Doll?
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
How goes it, darlin'?
Turn up your hearing aid.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
You're not having lunch?
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
What time is it?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
It's twenty after one.
Yes, sir.
Got yourself up?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Is this ill right?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Tennessee?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, you don't have to.
Incestuous.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Relax.
We should slow down.
Gimmie a butt.
Wha... ?
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
Hey...
Can't you say something nice once?
General Jim Beam, then.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know what I mean.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
That's not true.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
There's still good in him.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't kill my own father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
How are we doing?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Good shot, Red Two.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
Come with me.
I will not fight you.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Yes or no will do.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Certainly not!
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Right!
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Feeling
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's only temporary.
No, I don't belong here.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...What?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
...What?
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Paulie!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Don't do that again!
He won't last one round.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How was the flight, Champ?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Few minutes?
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Ya still light seventy.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Rocky.
No -- Just me.
Excuse me.
What?
Why?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
God bless ya, Rock.
It ain't your locker no more.
Bullmastiff.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
What can I do about it?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Check the scrawl.
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Romeo! Romeo!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Out--
Good heart, at what?
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
I take thee at thy word.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
If my heart's dear love--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
So thrive my soul--
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Why, may one ask?
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
This is important.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
What do you mean?
I take it you still want the money...
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Is it done?
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
American.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Is that right?
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Cigarette?
As in, they own it?
What'd you say to him?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Right now?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
So I do it.
Why not?
That's a good question.
Finish the job...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Can you get it?
What the hell happened here?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're -
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
It won't work.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I don't know...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
It's the right thing to do.
He's going to be trouble.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You're out of your mind.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Here it is.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
We've got to go now, then.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
You mean that guy was an agent?
What for?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Yeah I'm fine.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
And I'd take it out on him.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I don't know.  My friends...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Sheriff Hogan --
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Just goes to show you.
Jesse?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
It was going to be a surprise!
Oh Jesus Christ...
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I'm not getting an answer.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
The band has been playing over an hour.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
What?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm busy at the moment.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
Where are you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Who?
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Excuse me?
Is it hot in here?
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Get it out of here!
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Why did you help me?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
I think we should stop talking.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
No you didn't!
Yes.
This money is evidence.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
What's going on?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
You speak English!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
You like it?
Want some?
What?!
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
Yes.
My daughter.
She's fine.
Hello.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I still have work to do here.
What is he up to now?
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
I already made an appointment for later today.
Fisher, let him talk.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
And you defending her?
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Of what?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
It's fun!  It's high.
I already explained about that.
I'd rather not.
Yes, I did.
Used?
Reporter?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Is there somebody else?
You take the microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Happy New Year, darling.
You go.
I do.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
What?
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Yes.
I know.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
What?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Mom!
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Hello.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
And you're worried about him.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Hey, my plate is full.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Window.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It plays in 50 states.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Stressed.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What do you think?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Is that what she used to sing?
Great.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Okay.
I just called for a second.
Did too.
Get out.
No.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
You did?
You haven't tried locking them up!
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
This water's cold again.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Let them take it!
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Be still ...
Alone?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Go on. Spill it.
You know I don't think that.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Where's your mama?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
First rate, ain't it?
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Nothing.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
I'm kind of busy.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
What time is it?
You don't say.
Can you set that up?
Can I ask you something?
Wait till I tell you what it is.
No, I'm good.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Why do you say that?
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
I was getting to it.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Please ... don't do this ...
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Turns out he's connected.
What?!
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
And you've got wiener breath.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
We're in business.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Where are your men now?
So, where are you from?
The Army gave you that?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Captain, what about our deal?
Simpson.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
You alright?
And how do you bluff yourself?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Huh?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Here they come.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
You're tough, J-man.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Then what's love?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Yes.
Meaning?
Wait a minute.
Why?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
I can accept that.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
They really applauded you today honey.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
You should be.
What happened to you?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Saturday?
So you're monumentally busy?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Twisted?
Yeah?
You think so?
Okay.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Am I wrecking my car?
You're shaking.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
How do you know what I'm going to say?
What do you want?
You do?
Okay.
How's it going?
No.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Hello Lloyd.
Thanks Lloyd.
No, really.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I know this part, keep reading.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Certainly.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Give me my firebird keys!
We're full on bonded.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
What do I got for you?
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Good.  How's it going?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Are you losing money?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
I can do it, Captain.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
I could use some therapy.
I think he's doing Dolly.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Not one bit.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.
Go on, untie him.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Need some help, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
A twist ending if you will.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
Yeah, right.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
No, wait...
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Don't do this.
Can I come with her?
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
She's not here right now.
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
Do you work for her now?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
What do you mean?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
What?!
Nope.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you mean?
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Yeah?
Where are you Dewey?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
Someone stole Sid's file?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
What the hell are you doing?
Basements creep me out.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Yeah.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Where?
Yeah?
What? She asked.
Dude. What are you doing here?
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Yes, sir.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Who did you call?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I think you have the wrong number.
Hello.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Nah, I don't think so...
You getting scared?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
That all depends on you.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What are you doing here?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
And why is that?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
...out at the airport...
Stop. Right there.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
Wanna another beer?
Are you serious?
Do you believe this shit?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Take a message.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That's mature.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
What are you talking about?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Where we headed?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers like you?
I... I don't follow.
I realize that.
What?
Nothing.
And?
How did the fire fight end?
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.
We don't know for sure...
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
How do you know all about this?
It was him.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Wait!
Throw your gun down now!
This painting...
It smells good.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Perfect example.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
He cometh forth like a...
You got any more orders, Captain?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
I beg your pardon?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
You all right, Ethan?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Hey! What's the idea...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Think she means for us to follow?
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
Finish your breakfast...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Why else?
I have to cut his windpipe...
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Where have you been all day?
What?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
What?
Ellen Straub.
Do I look like it that much?
Mrs. Straub!
Follow that boat!
Really?
Do you know that house?
Thank you, my lady!
Tomorrow.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
Nothing comes.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Where are you going?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
How will it?
God bless you!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
When the Queen commands it.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
"Madam!"
I have lost my gift.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Better fortune, boy.
Who is there?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Let him be damned for his pages!
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
My lady Viola.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
No, sir.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
And her lips?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
Is there a man?
A theatre poet?
What's his name?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I'm only asking what you think.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
How much?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Looking for you? Yes.
They know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Well?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Just one thing.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
What?
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Open it.
Alex.
Hello. Hello.
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Burglary?
Of course.
Expecting anyone?
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
What guy that died?
A priest who dies.
Working nights?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Why?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I gotta talk to you.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
That headboard.
Are you?
You here to see my mother?
Did you hear me?
I asked you first.
Yeah.
No.
Right.
You do know what money's like these days.
I guess not...
Jesus...
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Jill's coming with us.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Did Lester know about him?
George... how about Felicia?
No! Don't! Please!
Sit down.
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
-- we are?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
You're going to kill me.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
No, man.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Wash her.
-- Oh yeah.
Otis is dead.
Not yet.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Keep moving --
Now, George --
I am?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
George?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Yeah, baby.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
What do you want?
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
I know, honey.
Now, Jackie --
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
-- and take this with you.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know, that's all.
-- A wash and set.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
When?
Layered?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
But...
Was it me, did you have something against me?
I'm coming over.
A soap?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
You and your touchy investors.
Shut the door, shut the door!
That's right.
Fine.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
You're really a love -- you sure?
But why Egypt?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Good for you.
-- why?
You're going?
You seem disappointed.
No... how long did you say?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Yes?
Oh,
What sort of injury did he have?
And, er... where are they now?
She eh... interferes.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Pleased to meet you.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
Any ideas yet?
Did you find anything?
He's still asleep.
Jack!
I can't really remember.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'll bring back a doctor.
I'm gonna go now.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Thanks.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Perhaps.
What about crack?  You a user?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
But how?
LET THY SPIRIT
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Yes, Betty?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Not in years.
Just about.  Show me again.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
What?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Shirelles.
Soprano or alto?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Mary Clarence!
Who are all these people?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Your name?
Very well.
Miss Van Cartier.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
What's a concubine?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Your cell is more than adequate.
Yeah?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
And if I don't?
Okay -- no limo.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Like what?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
How?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Hail, Mary.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Well?
Right.
Joey?
Neither did you!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
He's not like other guys.
Certainly not.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I hit him square.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
No bleeding.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring Young Masbath here.
What?
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Hmm?  See them?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
We should not go much further in this murk.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
We should go.
All I saw was their lantern.
What good is this?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
This is farewell.
What now?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
Must I hear this?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What... what are you doing... ?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
She did not do it... please listen...
All right then.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
They was a boy. We made friends.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
Don't hit that boy no more.
They let you out?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Maybe they needed it.
You want to go with me?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
He ain't no count.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Did Vaughan go home?
I know he does.
Yeah.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
You better go get your things.
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
I'll be.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Ma'am?
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
Yes sir.
So, you're really going to stay here?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
No, we have to get this story.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Signs?
What!
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Like me, too.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Not an easy book.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Uh, better make it one.
I'm all ears.
Every word.
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Seventeen.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
The refrigerator?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Just passing through.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Huh?
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Is your father an artist?
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
And?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
And started to run.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Hi, kid.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
It is.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Well, why does it?
That's when he fell.
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
What makes you think I play?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
I can't speak for him.
Improved...how?
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Are these your bags?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Those two musicians from the garage!
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
No we're not.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
But suppose it doesn't?
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Watch it, Daphne!
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Men?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Me?  After Sugar?
What happened?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Not that, you idiot.
Sugar?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
If there's anything I can do for you -
Stay as long as you'd like.
What did you say?
What's the surprise?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
What's that?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
How did those holes get there?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
About that roadhouse -
Another bridesmaid?
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Really?
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Saxophone player?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
You collect shells?
What?
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I don't mind if I do.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You're flattering me.
Nothing at all?
What happened?
Is that anything?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I know.  Every time!
PLEASE!
Booze.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
I never join nothin'.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
I already told you.
I should get going.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Nothing.
Shrink, actually.
Hey, Kat.
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
Mmm.
This happened to you?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Yes.
What?!
Are you sure?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Yeah. You?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You knew?
You want me to let him in?
It’s complicated, Dad.
Yeah.
I am now, sir.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
And you say all them people is dead now?
What's his name?
What he talk 'bout?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
It's cold, Daddy!
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
He'll show up one day.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
They gone to the field...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
You know somethin', Daddy?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Who is they?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Come, I'll take you home.
I'll walk...
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Little chilly.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
About what?
Okay.
Hey Cartman.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Mph rm rmph!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Dude, we don't have watches.
Be careful, dude.
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
How can they do this?
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Thank you, Kenny.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
But I-
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
NAZIS!!
You didn't?
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Well I appreciate that.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Were you going to give it to them?
On channel 10?
What did you say to me?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Idiot...
That's me.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
We're going to die.
That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
What are we going to do?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
He certainly is polite.
I don't know what we're facing.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Yeah?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I'm not going with you.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
So close...
Carlo!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
You have orange whips?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You know, Elvis bowled.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
100 years! 
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
No!
Nice set-up.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
Why would you help me?
After we eat, Dad.
Yeah.
I'm a bowler.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Kinda tough on the butt.
The mental hospital.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
Why were you suspended?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Too late for what, Sheila?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
How do you get this thing down?
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You're really pissing me off.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Fletcher!  Now!
I said back away.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Yeah.  I heard you.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Fifty yards and closing.
Thank you, Colonel.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Hold on --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I think I do.
Wait a second --
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Well, where the fuck is he?
Yes, Harry.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
That's quite a secret.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?
Yeah, why?
Beth --
Beth.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Where did you get this?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
But I don't know how --
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Three to six hours.
How fast does it take effect?
Not believing you.
What is it, Norman?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Are you manifesting them?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
But --
Yes.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Stop it!
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
What?
No.  I don't think so.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
You holding up alright?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Her suit's gone.
The three of us.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
She told me what you said, Norman.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
What report?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What kind of a crash was it?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Good morning!
You could put it that way.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I found it... It's just not there.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Get to the ship!
No need, everything's under control.
No!...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Are you safe?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Your father will never let you.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
I don't believe it !
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
So what are you doing later ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Well, whad'ya know...
WHERE IS IT ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Guess you gotta go.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Diz, see what you can do.
I won't quit !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Courage, I guess.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Hi, mom.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Kill the bitch.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir !
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Our data is being prepared.
Yes.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Granted.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Hold station...!
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Cal...
Sure plan to.
Go you Huskies?
Who?
What's it called?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But why the dalmation?
That: in an act of...
You're still here.
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
"Room Service!"
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Good morning.
Oh yeah.
...and we could get up every morning...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Water or mineral deposits.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
What?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
This horse is booked.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
What else?
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
I've always seen that.
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Look.
We're just talking about the...
Yeah.
I...I...
...yes...
An artist of your caliber...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
She won't stop crying...
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
I have to talk to you.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
What is the...?
You should.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Town's out of lilacs.
I can't find the writer.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I can't.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Then you're finished in show business.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
My oh my.
I don't got the money.
There's no witnesses...
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I hate when you say that.
How would you know sh...
Wow.  Who's that for?
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Yes.
I'll miss you so much.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
What if he's kidnapped?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You touched it.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
That's Rache's song!
No!  I have to get there.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
So we'll...radiate some more?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
I'm here.
Napalm.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
WE are over.
We're going to win this.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Ben never mentioned it.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You're the hip and fresh.
So I'll have to order in?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
What a great surpri...
Why in the world would she t...
Can we go sit somewhere?
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Don't ever say that.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
He was in a concentration camp?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Great to be here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
How did they execute him?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Jesus was not bad.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Sure!...
Ready for tomorrow?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You know he hated my story also.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Reconceive.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
The same.
Scooby?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Hello, Vi.
Uh huh.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Again!
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Anything I might know about?
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
I know.
Scooby?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Well get someone down there!
I'll lead.
Forget about it.
What do you mean?
What happened?
I have a lighter!
What about Cooper--where is he?
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Can I have a glass of water?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Yes, sir.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
What?
Just the missiles.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
No kidding.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
I've got one.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
What's your point, Lothar?
Recall what mistake?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Mm-hm.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Now?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
I'd get bored.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
I know, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
She's dead?
No, no, no.
Oh, you were in the band?
Yes! Free concert!
Score! Yeah!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yeah!
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Yeah. So, what about you?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
I'd like to.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
What was your name again?
Deep down. Way down.
Taking care of business.
Oh, wow.
Mm.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Uh-huh.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Wow. You did that for me?
Oh, shit.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Just go home, alright?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Like what?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
What?
I, yeah.
For a ride.
To his hotel?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Like songs?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I don't know.
Get off my property!
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Yeah.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Would I get paid?
Yeah.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Sorry, Kansas...
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
I'm sorry.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah, hold on.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
You want us to help you pick up?
More proof God's a guy...
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
If I could be of any help...
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
May I say you smell real special.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
This is where you live?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
It is not.  Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
You can stay here.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
I've lost my car.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
"Mad about the boy."
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Why do you say that?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
I'm not here.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
You think so?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Someone's chasing him.
You bet your ass.
I don't understand.
There isn't any.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
I was on Earth...
Shouldnt've done that.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
That horrible woman!
But it's impossible.
You can use the wand.
Yeah? What do you want?
What?
Mr. Roebush?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
First paycheck?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
So where is all them half-centses?
How many sugars?
Which country?
What?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Stone mutha.
We gonna crash?
What about you?
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
85,000 dollars.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Jimmy, how's the -
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Lois, someday --
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
But . . ..that's terrible!
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Does she know about it? She's in it!
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Good. My heart can't take it.
I think he said a "curl."
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
		DELETE IN CUTTING
He's captured Non!
I really don't think . . .
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Impossible? Why?
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
I think there's an angle.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
What do you fear?
I know, but  --
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
One of them should've been you.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Not...gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're not the only one.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Screaming
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Oh.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
You think he's for real?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
You're happy, aren't you?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
I don't understand.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I'm wearing it.
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
He is. Usually.
Right on the first guess.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
How much do you weigh?
Uh-huh.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
There.
I still don't get it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
On radio waves?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
But you said...
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
My name is...
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I have to.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.
That's what he said, is it?
It's interesting.
It's like a song.
That's right.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Yes.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Dolores.
I have no questions.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Have they ever been busted?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Daddy?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
What for?
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
What is it?
Is there shrimp on it?
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
You can't come here.
No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Any criminal record?
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.
What's so funny?
Do you like the colour?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Alone or surrounded?
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Did she accept?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
I know Manny Davis.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Talk to her, Sidney...
I thought he would.
Could this be that boy?
I don't think so.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Steve, I...
Those lying motherfuckers!
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Why?
Affirmative.
Pain causes it?
Drive faster.
No shit?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
What does he mean, too correct?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
You bet.
What?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
I have a duty.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
I'm sorry.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Von der Null?
This is absolute nonsense!
I don't understand what you mean.
Do you know what that is?
Do you know what's in this archive?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Nope.
Sure.
First oboe.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Anything else?
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
What's it to ya?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
What's he like?
Bag some Z's?
What about it?
What's that?
I want it to be over for you.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Someone?
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Here's her driver's license.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Call her.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Did you play recently?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You've got to be kidding.
What are you talking about?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
It was a gift... from my brother.
I'll wait.
You're the one who started running.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
A fresh shirt...
Right.  Call me Christy.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Okay.
What is this!?
Get out of my car!
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What... what do you mean?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
... what... ?
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
Nicholas...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Yes.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Will you?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Do it for YOU.
How do you know?
Really?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
It was a different floor then...
I need the police.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
No.
He hasn't called back.
That could have been worse.
Well, this lot is full!
You could have.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Welcome Home.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Oh!  You scared me.
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
David?
Theo... Did you?
Why?
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I like the colors.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Where do we go?
This is un-fucking professional.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
I can take care of the paperwork.
No reason.
Huh?
Terry Valentine.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Really.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Not embarrassed.
Disappointed.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Who remembers.
Only in the movies.
He alive to see this?
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
You sure?
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
What d'you mean, any happier?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Like what.
He's expecting you?
You know her?
Hello there.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Are you finished?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Tell you ...
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes, Ann?
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Huh.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
You got the dough?!
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
...Was that a pass?
Way out of line.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
It was Big Dave's.
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
So... who... who actually--
...who among us is in a position to say...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Yeah.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You sure, Eddie?
Huh?
We're just closing, friend.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
What happened to them?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
I smell it.  It's here.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Got my hands full here.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
What is it?
Big as a house.
That's impossible.
How does it work?
And John?
A monster?
What happened?
They're all heavily armed.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
That's right.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What's to see?
--a dead one at that.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Amnesia.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
Now.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Nursery?
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
I know.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
I don't know--
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
You're the one talking to the walls!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
When you get to Fiji?
Good.  Good.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
You looking for him for some other reason?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
I think you're full of shit.
Jesus, Mulder...
How's that?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
They were the ones that put us together.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
I was until about an hour ago.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
What? What's wrong?
Cold...
We've got to keep moving.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
She adores you.
No.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Peter, okay?
With Stargher I saw things...
I did, yeah.
Wait...
He's mine?
Thank you.
No problem.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
I need you to find something in the basement...
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
What about the cat?
I don't have to.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
...you know.
...Headquarters.
Harry.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
He works in a military hospital.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Which side of the road?
How about the doorway?
It wouldn't work.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Never heard of him.
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
You can help her.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
What do you want me to do?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
...the best way one can, you know.
Baron Kurtz.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Yes.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Oh, you did.
Something wrong.
Joseph Harbin.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Traveler.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
I don't know - I'm American.
What!
Yes.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
No one follows that midrash.
Oh, please...
Why the fuck not?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I have a job.
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Your father??
Where'd you get this?
Why not?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
What's it about?
And belief follows?
Fuck that.
You shouldn't.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
That's a much easier game.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
A forty-five.
I can't say that.
You do it on the inside....
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
And what did you do?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Leary?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
We tested the new bomb.
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Did you tell him?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
He seems to have won it.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
No.
No.
Congratulations, Enzo.
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
What are you doing here?
... Not yet.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Noireuter.
Great!
That's good.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Here...  Here...
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
How can you tell it's a female?
Hello?
How are you?
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis!
It's my apartment.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
It's Esther.
Any sign of Santa?
Want to get a drink?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
You two know each other?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Cool. What's it do?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
What are you doing?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
So, how was I?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
See you tomorrow —-
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Show business?
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
That was unfortunate.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
That might depend on where you’re going.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Good.
...We’re turning in circles.
Something like that.
Where is that?
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
A criminal?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Then find another way.
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
Where?
Where are the kids?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Piss off!
Your secretary, huh!
I hope it’s not too significant.
What if it is?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Is my money in there?
This car needs petrol.
Maybe I don’t.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
No...
I know his work better than I know him.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
So why didn’t he?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Cost what?
I would like some fresh straw.
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
No no, I'm fine, really...
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Praying.
You think?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Wait, wait...
For what?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
The wind will be against us...
We need another ten minutes...
Damn right!
Jeanne, look behind you.
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What have you done to me?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Why were you yelling like that?!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
What for?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
Is that bad?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
I need help.
For what? For my tie?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
It costs.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
That's better than yesterday.
I can look after myself!
Otherwise what?
Very appropriate.
But I want to help, I want to.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Where are we going?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Szpilman.
To be deaf?
Like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Wash them again.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
What?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
If that's the way you want it.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You know anything about him?
Why?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He threatened to kill me.
You think he'll show?
Henry.
Yeh.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
But what about all these other people?
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
You doin' anything tonight?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
So could Shaw.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
You're dreamin', kid.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
How am I gonna do that?
Don't think I know him.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
He was?
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Another young man.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
There. 
Why... in the heart.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Where are you going?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
You can take that out to the car.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
Well, what'd you think?
Trail him!  Trail who?
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
You mean that body-----?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
What bonds?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
What'll I do if something comes up?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Where's Gilbert?
But he has nothing to do with it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
Can't you get to sleep?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
But it's Christmas now.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
There's one coming.
Finished with these?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
But Wynant --- ?
You bet I wouldn't.
What do you mean?
What things made you so sure?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Is that true?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Yes.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Paper.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
They stopped.
Wha...
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What about it?
Get off him.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Then step aside.
No.
I out rank you, that's why.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Wes--
Give it to me!
Knock it off!
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Is it dead?
Wait.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Sure.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I pick that way.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
...Wes...?
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
He's not slowing.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
That's in two days.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
If!  If there's a treasure.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
HUMMMM.....
You know I don't feel well.
What time is it?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I've got it!  Astounding!
I want you for my roommate.
When?.....How?
I don't know.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I'm sorry.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
Officer Reilly, vice.
Where did you get this?
What're you talking about?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Which one's which?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Would you?
Yeah, another round thing.
Which one's which?
Bev, you're the greatest...
You touch me again and--
What about the ballistics report?
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Yes, sir.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
What did you talk about?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Two weeks and three days.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I've got to see you.
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
No--no.
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston Monescu.
Right.
Seven and nine!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes...?
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Naturally I did.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Eighteenth century.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Beautiful specimen.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
I'll be delighted.
Then a little nap--
You would?
Yes, I would!
I'm crazy about you!
You look beautiful.
<u>Adolph</u>?
I don't believe it!
Goodbye...
It could have been marvelous ...
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes, madame?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
That's true.
The pumps --
Shit.
The partners want to know how it's going?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
You told me to change.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
You're welcome. Rose.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Are you nervous?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
You jump, I jump, right?
It's getting quiet.
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Oh--a hundred times--
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
I thought you were one of my friends.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
Good-by!
Yes?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
You mean that?
Lose?--I won a little--
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
No, sir?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Are you screwy?
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
How?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Who won?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
What do you mean?
So what?
Is that one of the Who's Who?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
--you'd go with him!
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
That's the truth--every single word!
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I want them spitting blood!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Come on, you...
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
This brand.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
That's great coming from you.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
That was lovely!
You're a little touchy about it.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
What about her?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I hate Sadie.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Really?  You sure?
I need it.
'Least they don't scare women.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
His newspapers?
Fishing?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Sidney Winch, meet -
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Not a lot of difference.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
If not?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What's your name?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
He brought that up from the wreck.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
You have to leave -
What the hell is going on?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
What did your wife get her?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Junior spends time with his child.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Like a veil has been lifted?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Your feet are cold.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good morning.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Now who are we talking about?
Those boys never did have good luck.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
None of your business.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
I was just trying to make conversation.
How are you?
Wow!  Cool!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
What are you doing over there?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
No, you can't.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
What happened to you?
Shhhhhhh!
Great!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Oh no, Hannah!
That ain't no happy child.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
What the heck is up there?
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Okay, we're on the last present now...
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
No, Slink --
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
You're only a young thing.
Finn -
Finn ...
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
How much?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Did you get it?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
That's frustrating.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Did you meet the President?
Caroline --
Did you tell Dad?
Is this bad for him?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
How are your grades?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
So go shower already.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
That's good coke.
What's he doing up here?
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Where?
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
I'm aware of that.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
Bit fucking late, like.
Shag her senseless.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Jesus.
Eh-
Diane.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Easy for you to say.
Is that a promise, then?
Smells like it.
So why have you told me about it?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Following the game at all?
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
What about The Untouchables?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Great.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sounds great, Swanney.
This had better be good.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
What?
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
This is the Starship Enterprise.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
The power was within you.
But how?
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Oh, God
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Spock.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
About the ship...
No special conditions?
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
He's not?
No. I will not.
Each man's pain is unique.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Come on in...
Yeah...?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
For sure...
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
How about over there...that empty memory?
Hey... you guys OK?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
Why is everything...like this?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
It's something Users do.
That's not true, honey--
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Yes.
Fourteen, Harry.
You want me to just hang-- ?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
She's still at my house.						*
Now what?
I thought this look like your work.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
What?
Louder please.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Yes.
Are we going to die?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
The letter I sent.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turn-ons?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Uh-huh.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I don't believe so.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Is this a joke?
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Money problems?
This shit can't be real.
Is he big league?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Clarence...
No. But thanks.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
I can see what you mean.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Why does he trust you?
I'm really not very -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
I'm your son.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I got some money I can give you -
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
On their honeymoon.
What about him?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Do you believe him?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Suspect's words -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
You do more than try.
- Because it's good!
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No way, JosÈ.
Him?  You saw that man?
I understand.  There'd be no point.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
I need to go now.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
No.
No, 1995 is the past.
What?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
Give me the gun.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
What does this mean to you?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
You really want to know?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
That a fact?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Nothing.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Hundred-fifty.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes.  Yes it is.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Who was that on the phone?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You've been around.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Like they're made of polyester.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You just walk away.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Is it pretty?
How much money has he got?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
To get my car.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
What?
You killed him!
He was going to--
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I'm here.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Live there?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Would I what?
No.
Hungry?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How do you put a price on murder?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You didn't kill her?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Jake--
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
I want to stay.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hey!  You there!
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
A lot that means.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
That's a bit much.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
I've had time to get over it.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
You sure you can manage?
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Yeah.
Where?
What do you mean?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Why's that?
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
What'd you say to me!
How much?
Genuine Draft?
Morning Grace.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
What's the matter?
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Is Noel in?
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
Megan?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I don't know Megan.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Yeah?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
What things?
How much is it?
I see.
Twelve years.
How so?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
I fined 'em instead.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
What'd he say?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He give 'em names?
Yeah, I guess.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
Ned's share?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Huh?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Better re-load it.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
First one I ever killed.
Lemmee see it.
You could have it. All of it.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Two weeks, I guess.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Yeah?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
He's blind, for Chri...
Well, suppose he does?
An' if I spot 'em?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
There was ninety-one million -
Who ?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
This is not right.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
Can we stealth these guys?
County. I was in for fraud.
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
Tough break.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
The answer is no.
Who is he?
Which is shit.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
He loved her.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
He wanted me to live.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Yes.
What is the truth?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
Anything special about the case?
Thank you.  When Debby...
No.
No.
Through, through his book.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
It's a crime.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I.  Yes.  It is.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Do you know who her doctors were?
You know what happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I need an extension for my case.
What?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
This is Miss Costello...?
Missus...
Laura.
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
And what makes you so tough?
You're pressuring yourself...
Dr. Gruber.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
I have to talk to you.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
How are you holding up?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... You saw her?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What did she say?
One hour.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Another, Frank . . . ?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
The Big Boy did...?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
How often does this happen?
I -- I --
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Will you have dinner with me?
An hour?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Don't go.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You don't even want to touch me.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, Ernie's is fine.
How does it work?
Why?
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
I don't know... Switzerland?
No...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
No.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How old?
Where are you now?
Where?
Where were you born?
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes --
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Yes?! But --
No, never!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
You can't.
Madeleine --
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Her car is gone.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
What.
How?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Is she pretty?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The hell I don't.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm calling the ambulance.
There's more.
Just stop.
What about the blood?
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
What?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
What?
Later.
Real times.
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
I won't do it.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I want you to hear me out.
Money?
Well, oh...
Who?
That's right.
Your investment ideas never work out.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
What's your fucking point?
He just had two.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
What?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Nope.
And what happens when you can't?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Easy Micheal.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Of course.
Seating problems.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not yet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Are they fighting?
No way.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Who's dead?
It's too late.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
He kept saying he was protected.
No...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
You're not breathing right?
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
Greenpeace?
Yeah?
"You Send Me."
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
What do you mean?
Evil.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Do they worry you that much, then?
Things seem to be getting better.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Yes!
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
What's the assignment?
Think you can do it?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
I'M WHAT?!
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
You all right?
You ready for this?
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Relax. I know what you meant.
This isn't a game, Parker!
What's the problem?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
You're not capable of it.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
There you go —— best seat in the house.
What if he's busy tonight?
What about it?
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Izzat the thing...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
Come on.
...where?
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
We're going to have to explain away the...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...
What would do that...?
...where is the Back End coming from?
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Anything at the Airport?
...this's <u>good</u>...
...uh huh...
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Hello...?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.

Who're you working for?
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
Remember the Maine...
We don't need an Act Two.
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
What?
I saw it on TV.

Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...

...but...
Don't tune it too good.
It's too clean.
I go with this here...

Yes.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Oh, hell...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
It concerns his future!
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You sure about this FAA announcement?
What brings you out here...
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
I guess it's time to hit the road.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
He never told me...
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...I can't even see it...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
What? How do you know about my father?
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
What makes you think you can?
How much is enough Gordon?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Gordon.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
You told him about us?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
With Mark?
He still likes you
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Anybody want another drink?
Jenkins!
No?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Oh that explains everything.
Well?
Yes?
Because he was worried about me.
Do you really think so?
These are good.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
Yes, but...
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
I'm sorry?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Oh-kay...
Who?
You do?
Would you like some iced tea?
No.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
No, I don't.
You look a little old for a student.
She never mentioned her father.
What was her major?
This is...
Stop.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
The planchette?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
I was down in Adamant...
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's okay if you're not.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
You are so brilliant.
Sorry.  You understand.
What's going on, Claire?
See?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
When?
When you do this, I swear...
Are you lonely?
How did you--
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Sweetheart--
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Do I have everything?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But I don't remember.
Your wife...
"You know..."
Oh God...
Claire, please don't...
Who?
We have to get out of here.
How can you be sure?
What?
Don't think so.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Michael...  Do what you can.
uh - then he - be just -
To love, you must be able to feel.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
I don't know what you are!!!
No!
What do you see...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Hello...?
Do you love me, Michael...?
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Wanna snack...?
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You okay...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
Sounds good - thank you
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Yes it is...
This must be one of the old keys -
Sure...
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't know...
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
You've killed but you're not a killer
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
We've got nothing to talk about
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
What's wrong with you?
It's been what, three years?
I thought it was you - how are you?
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Whatever helps you cope.
You do know how to drive?
Some of them have to be automatics.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Most places are, Jimmy.
I miss them, too.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Do you trust me, Julie?
That's hard to believe.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Like what?
As much as possible.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
I was like a different person tonight.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
It's our job, Gloria.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Where's Lombardo?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
I said he did.
What?
It's those rocks, up there.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Curiosity, I guess.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Where, the mall?
You know what it takes.
I'm here.
Hello.
Duquette.  Forget him...
I just want my life back...
You can't...
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Davy.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Jesus, man... You okay?
But I..
What?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
J. S. Bach.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
But don't pull that again.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Almost?
Know what this is?
This is good.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Oh, thank you.
My hat is off to you, sir.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
You bring the best out in a man.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
That would be... the Mexican War?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
I beg your pardon?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
They look like acorns.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Then you get us out of here.
Are you okay?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
She's a bird, Willow.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
What do you want!
No!
How am I gonna do that?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
Why?
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Queen Cherlindrea?
Milking?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
You have no right to keep us here.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
You admit you're lying?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
I don't know where he is.
Yes, thank you very much.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I am not a child.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Tight. But I'm working on him.
My son is out there!
Is this where we're going?
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
...have you come back?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Ahh!  Ah!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Toto's my dog.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Whenever you wish.
Are you ready now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Aw, come, come, come --
...her face is careworn.
Uh-huh.
...room --
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And him a brain.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Did they hurtcha?
I have so got brains.
...don't talk.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
...ting the ruby slippers?
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Who at?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Whozat?
You don't get around us that easy!
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh - look out.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh --
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Well, I --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
He’s sealed himself in.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
He survived?
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Does this look familiar to you?
I can’t stay here.
I can’t stay.
You turned Renard.
So you killed your father.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
And the payoff on the tables?
Mother of God.
The Maiden’s Tower.
What is this place?
I’ll send someone out.
Someone will come.
Warm.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Wrong answers?
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
She's with me.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Damn straight.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
What are you up to?
They're practically on us . . .
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What do you mean, frame-up?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Thanks.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Whatchu doing here?
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
"Anarchy" 99"?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Yorgi and Kirill.
You okay?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What was that for?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
What are you talking about?
What's that?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
You know, you --
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
He takes his work seriously.
Where am I?
Who?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
A piece.  Only a piece.
I'll find him.
Is that so?
No!
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
What in God's name are you doing?
What?
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Surprised?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
That's a tough choice.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Fron kon steen!
A week.  Ten days at most.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Could be worse!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Don't fall for that one.
Original.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
That sound good, boss.
There's only one way.
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
May I see your violin?
And look at this, Doctor!
It looks that way.
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Four
Food!!
Foooooood!
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
